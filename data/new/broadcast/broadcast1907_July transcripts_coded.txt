Rypien isn't the first athlete to say they think they have c-t-e. many athletes have voiced similar
concerns, and some deceased athletes have been found to have the disease... krem 2's ian
smay explored some notable examples of athletes who spoke about worries surrounding c-t-e,
or who were found to have suffered from the injury. thanks guys. c-t-e, or chronic traumatic enceph-uh-lop-oh-thee, is a degenerative disease that affects the brain of people with histories of
repeated brain trauma, like football players and professional fighters. the repeated hits to the
head harm brain tissue. c-t-e symptoms include memory loss, impulsive behavior, depression
and suicidal thoughts. it can also cause Parkinson’s...and eventually, dementia. former n-f-l
quarterback mark rypien was arrested on Sunday for domestic violence, which he has since
pleaded not guilty to. but he is far from the first athlete to have alleged or confirmed violence
issues linked to c-t-e. another former n-f-l player is the late Aaron Hernandez, who played for
the new England patriots. Hernandez was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison without
parole for the 2013 murder of odin lloyd. then, on April 19, 20-17, Hernandez was found dead,
hanging in his prison cell. an autopsy revealed what experts said at the time was the most
severe case of c-t-e in a young person. another n-f-l player who had c-t-e found after his death
was jovan belcher, who played linebacker for the Kansas City chiefs. belcher shot and killed his
girlfriend in 2012 before driving to the parking lot of the chiefs training facility and taking his
own life. an autopsy showed he also had signs of c-t-e. moving on to the wrestling world, chris
ben-wuah was a professional wrestler beloved by fans then...in 2007, he took the life of his 7year-old son and his wife before committing suicide. he was found to also have signs of c-t-e.
o.j. Simpson has also spoken about how he's afraid he has c- t-e because he often has trouble
remembering words and the names of friends. now, these aren't the only athletes to have
worries or confirmed cases of c-t-e, as thousands of former n-f-l players previously opened a
lawsuit against the league over c-t-e concerns. it is also important to note that c-t-e can
currently only be confirmed during a post-mortem autopsy.

we're hearing stories from a live event in seattle co-hosted by sound effect and fresh ground
stories was tyree story that first suggested the evening's mean to me small miracle it's how
works in sales in seattle and he first told the story had a fresh ground stories event warning it
deals with the subject of suicide if you want to sit this one out it's about 10 too long so I wasn't
supposed to becoming homeless drug addict and petty criminal my family growing up was kind
of like the huxtables if deo really like to smoke crack and it really was my insistence on doing
things my way that it led me where I was to turn me from a highly successful mortgage
professional very highly paid in 2006 and to it down now homeless person in 2014 and really
bad decision making was my downfall over and over again that decision about my money about
my girlfriends about my associates my activities and really led me down a bad road is an
example all some great decision making I would implore way in 2012 after 10 years of very hard
drug use I decided no longer wanted to be cliche black guy named tyrone who smoked crack
and so I quit immediately and switch math breaking the color barrier there so with decisionmaking like that obviously homelessness was the definite place I was going to end up in now it's
2015 the summer i've been homeless for about a year now and standing up for 100 dollar night
hotel room in downtown Seattle that i've gotten by far less than honest means i'm alone in this
feeling of desperation and loneliness starts to wash over me pick up my phone and text my
friend who just left the room of course to go get more drugs and saying I won't be here when
you get back when she asked why my response is simply i'm tired I can't do this anymore I
turned off my phone I put on my backpack mr. ahead towards the door and as I do think back
to just a couple of months earlier win although god I always had a kind of a contentious
relationship wasn't such a place of desperation that actually prayed to god that my life would
get better and get to looks like something more normal some now I wondered as I headed
towards the door why those prayers gone unanswered how could god who supposedly love me
so much forget about me has got the elevator that pushed down button my thoughts turned to
my family and what will my family I think when they find out that this one time ego maniac who
are so concerned about how he looked and what people thought in his image what will they
think when they find out that he's dead because he walked himself and trafficking an obvious
suicide would end up dead on the streets is underweight haggard and homeless I feel some
pain for just a second and only his second because my thoughts turn back to me this is my
moment I can't think about them this about me ending my pain and my shame and my guilt as
the elevator arrives here it's summer so it's their condition so cold inside and there's nobody in
it so it's cold and it's empty just the way I feel right at that moment get on the elevator push the
down let them as the elevator begins to descend my plan becomes clear were in my head okay
with 4th floor go out to the street also one of my last cigarette third floor watch traffic really
carefully because I need to pick the right moment could dash into it second floor t's got to be a
big truck and S.U.V. does not want to get injured I want to hit ended lobby doors open I may
move out to the sidewalk as quickly as I can take my cigarette I start to smoke it is a beautiful
summer Seattle Saturday night the streets are electric there are people walking and talking and
laughing connecting with each other something I had forgotten how to do long ago lots of cars
on the street I think to myself for a lot of good chances here to do what I need to do some
2

standing there about halfway through my cigarette and just looking out into traffic and of the
corner of my eye I see this person starting to approach me I looked at him he looked a little
book and haggard like idea it so I thought he might be homeless or 6 Seattle he might have
been a hipster I wasn't sure which once but I thought he was going to come and ask for my last
cigarette because on the streets of Seattle I don't know if you know this but she never smoked
a pack alone but instead of asking for a cigarette he asked me for help and his story was this he
was an alcoholic you think of his house by his wife he's staying at p union gospel mission hasn't
eaten in a couple days I can help them out with some food and I have a thought I don't have
any money even on staying in this very expensive hotel room but have some money my food
card and you can't take it with yeah somebody might as will make use of it so I agree to help
them start walking to a 7 11 just a couple blocks away he's trying to engage in conversation
what's your name ss I say it doesn't matter anymore we're live and live anywhere but that
doesn't matter anymore he's starting to get a sense that maybe there's something larger going
on with me so fall silent for a few seconds and he said something quite frankly shocks me he
turns and says you know god has a plan for you greg I kind of bleak for a couple seconds and I
turned to look at him and I say it doesn't matter what god's plan this I can't do this anymore i'm
tired I turned away so you can see starting to tear up we get the 7 11 go in the store by him
whatever I can nixon very quickly even though he's still trying to talk to me you're engaged with
me in some way because I felt like I still have to deal with I had to do and nothing was going to
stop that when I get to the sidewalk street that mere moments before were busy bustling with
lots of people lots of traffic are empty now when I say the street was empty I don't mean
there's a couple people walking around there's a couple of cars moving down the street I mean
there's absolutely no people and there's no carts this strikes me as very odd so I woke up to
across street and look up and down I know people you know cards under my breath I say are
you f king kidding me I take my last cigarette I sit on the sidewalk and start to smoke and I say
to myself I guess tonight is not the night did I got it's now in the movie my life starring will smith
likely directed by spike lee this would be the moment when the clouds both parts I will learn all
my lessons and the very next day I will turn my life around unfortunately for me my life is not a
movie and quite frankly I hadn't had enough punishment yet lake have not kicked my butt
enough for me to learn my lessons but luckily for me and just a few more months I had enough
and I was able to start making some positive change my life often people ask me how do you
make such a monumental change going from someone who was sleeping instill in hotel rooms
or under a bridge or getting high and not sleeping at all just walking home life to someone who
is gainfully employed as 11 his friends and family and is actually productive member of society
there's a lot of things I could point to but two things stand out very strongly for me number one
having had the opportunity to live in a sober home now for those of you were unfamiliar with
sober holmes these are safe stable environment where people like me who need to get a
recovery and stay away from drugs and alcohol can live to re-establish their lives it was
incredibly instrumental in me being able to lead like that somewhat normal and these are very
important places for folks number two I’m irritating we optimistic I see the best of everything I
tend to live my life ingratitude and focus on the things that have instead of what right now and
quite frankly in while most days it would be nice to have a million more dollars and be 3% body
fat the fact is that I have more than what I need and I’m really grateful for what ahead of 20

3

other things I’m also grateful for the opportunity to be here with you tonight so thank you so
much for listening.

one man is using the annual event to speak out about an issue that's deadly serious. Evita garza
explains. Evita: "mike long travels across the country to spread awareness about veterans with
PTSD and suicide... and the Eugene rodeo is one of those stops." long... who is a disabled
veteran himself...sets up an information in each city where he stops. veterans who may be
struggling --- or their families --- can stop by and get information on various services that are
available to help. his overall message is simple. "I’d do anything and everything I can to be the
hands of kindness and ask America to join me in this...and whatever it takes to keep a veteran
alive." long started his journey four years ago and says he has traveled over eighty thousand
miles. this is his first time setting up at the Eugene rodeo... but not his first time in Oregon.

tomorrow is the first day of the Eugene pro rodeo....and one man traveled far to be there. his
goal -- to spread awareness about a cause that's very close to him. kezi 9 news reporter evita
garza shares his story and how he's working to make a difference. mike long is a united states
army veteran from Texas. he joined the army in 1975...toward the end of the Vietnam war.
decades later and a now a disables veteran... long has seen how post-traumatic stress disorder
can affect veterans and how easily it can lead to suicide. now... he's using his own experiences
to change the lives of other veterans by traveling the country -- meeting with veterans and their
families everywhere. "my mission has been to be an instigator, the roots of America to help
veterans stay alive. the more people involved can be a support team." his journey started four
years ago and long says he goes on these trips every chance he gets. "with over eighty thousand
miles on his car from the last four years... mike long has traveled far and wide with his trusty
partner coco to get his message spread across the country." even though he is a part of the
Texas based group American hero network...who advocates for the same cause...long is
completely self-funded and even sleeps in his car with coco, his service animal, most nights he's
traveling. and he doesn't care.... because he knows that there are veterans out there struggling
more than him. "i don't mind. I got veterans sleeping out there in the dirt. I can go through this
for 30 to 45 days ever so often." and with these trips...long hopes that he's setting an example
for everyone to be kind...especially to our veterans.

Suicide now as you may know the pacific northwest was home to the very first government on
planet earth to legalize doctor-assisted suicide now I oppose the idea at the time my still
oppose today a lot of it is based on some very faulty promises like the idea that we cannot
relieve people's pain if they're in the last few months of a terminal illness that is not true today
it was perhaps true 20 years ago but for whatever reason the voters in the legislature decided
to back up the idea of allowing doctors state licensed physicians to be allowed to help
somebody killed himself or herself but that apparently wasn't good enough because now a
senate bill and I realize a lot of these bills got past did not get a lot of attention at the time and
that's because much of the attention was going to the new taxes the crazy environmental
proposals being made by the rules senate bill 5 79 which we mentioned a few months ago but
god's passage it is going to be signed by the governor it removes the requirement that a neardeath patient wait 15 days before killing themselves by legal assisted suicide the bill would also
allow somebody with malicious intent to pressure a dying person to request receive and take
deadly drugs on the same day rather than considering other options the bill creates a
dangerous loophole in Oregon’s doctor-assisted suicide law the bill removes the waiting period
in the law that is designed to prevent abuse same day suicides and protect vulnerable
Oregonians from being coerced into ending their lives and I it's hard to imagine a more
vulnerable position to be and then somebody who believes that the end is near for them but
for many of them they will receive a diagnosis some time ahead of time but to simply walk into
a doctor and say i'd like to do it today the same day I asked this is going to create a situation for
bad actors to continue to harm the elderly which is already a significant problem in 20s 16
alone there were almost 4000 reported victims of elder abuse removing the waiting periods will
facilitate on demand same-day assisted suicide and it will not protect patients from corps
version Oregon’s doctor-assisted suicide law already lacks effective protections to prevent
somebody from administering a prescription to a patient illegal late if a patient has a suicide
prescription and ends up dead the assumption will be the they took it but there's no real
oversight to make sure the that's what happened senate bill 5 79 allows to pressure the person
to get the drugs received drugs and take the lethal drugs on the same day I think it's a terrible
idea.

i'm a Christian a conservative have worked in health care about her laugh 12 a few years my
healthcare and background of anywhere from the match it david I do it to the point though
because we're running out of time to talk about the actual subject i'll accept your resonate
what we're doing I disagree I think giving same day suicide is crazy well read and without me I
have to work and I used to watch family for made the decision to allow other families and
people to question if to that point the end of life that no matter how big the fire I am and I
think beat you work the person dying in that bed doesn't buy the right mind they often die with
delirium confusion the matomy pain meds on board there's just confused what happens so a
5

pretty big guy out of my I like you agree with me you want a delirious confused person to make
a decision and his or her own life on a single day I would no oversight I want I want a family that
know that person to make that decision I know the difference but hold on a second david
because you're allowed to do advance medical directives and you are allowed to tell your family
members if i'm in a coma under these circumstances you can decide to disconnect life support
as far as I know there isn't a single assisted suicide law that allows your family member to make
the decision for you when you are incapacitated do I know that wrong third you're worried you
don't most do that on a lot of that I look at her background and the docr if you don't people
people like the family unh-unh unh-unh david you're telling me the doctor assisted suicide laws
Oregon Washington allow a third party to decide without an independent conscious decision by
the person who's affected I don't think that's the case the law the law says if you have to
approach your doctor you have to approach doctoring convince them that you wore of of the
right mind to make the decision even under doctors is a suicide which I think is a terrible law
but you're allowed to go to your doctor and say i'm going to be dead within 6 months I like to
have them the medical means to kill myself I don't have to agree with that but that's the law
where do you see in the law that a third party could make that decision no matter how well
qualified they are I would just quickly how are documented medical background I mean if I have
a history of but no david you're talking about something that isn't in the law you want the
ability going into the future for a third party to say gramm was pretty out of it what we what we
put down and you want the law to say that dr site you seem to be pretty smart about this stuff
you know your grandma so guy here's the means to put down you really want a third party to
make that decision for somebody who's very ill did I do actually I found pretty dark but well I
think it is I cannot think of a cheery version of that we're gram law is not able to think straight
and may even be unconscious but she has really smart grandson who will probably stand to
inherit some money probably tired of going to hospital the old folks home to visit grandma he is
yeah he's a bad time gramm much check out and can you think of a cheery version of that I
mean dr raff make the decision know the doctor does not make good decisions under the
assisted suicide law the person who wants to die past to make the decision you're suggesting
we should now allow anybody who's smart enough and somehow connected to the person to
make the decision for them right that's what you suggest I do yeah I mean broadly if you
wanted to be medicated administrator says you know our costs are really up this quarter we
get off about a 100 old people are costing us a lot of money we get our costs are quarter would
be back line we did back in the black again you want them to make that decision i'm not being
facetious ifor see the day when government is going to say the most expand you tell me if i'm
wrong the most expensive 3 months of almost anybody's life are the last 3 months when you're
suffering from a terminal illness an amazing amount of money being spent on you if you're on if
we get a medicare for all under crazy bernie or camilla harris they're going to be administrators
say wage sure be able to straighten out the finances of this place we just off a bunch of these
old people going to die anyway so waterway just knock them down I mean that sounds pretty
to put it dan you think can you think of a cheery way to do that I no way to solve Medicare’s
shortfall money let's kill all the old people does that sound sure enough I don't think we're at
that Medicaid short of money David week so we can save a ton of money if we just take on
those old gram wasn't gram pause and put the ground but they are head in that way anyway I
mean you want to okay my question is we seem to be edging that direction Oregon was the
6

first government on earth okay doctors to suicide we said but there are all these double checks
and triple checked she got to get a doctor you got to get a second opinion the doctor us believe
in your right mind I want to take it from there to anybody who knows him well and seems to be
smart enough can tell the doctor time for David to check out and David your daughter yeah I i
think that we could have for my record what you want about you want to go there or do you
want to push back against that like I am I would believe we've been with the like yeah I think
we need to look at it and be I really realized that I mean there's a more merciful to our path to
our human I mean my god my about 15 years old when he limped around how often I think
considering the time to put him down so we're putting iran on a par with your dog know i'm a
fan I love my dogs I do not put them on par with my wife my grandchild and you are i'm just
telling you you're going down a dangerous path i'm saying where we show more murphy
toward dhaka we do you recommend mercy as you can walk through most nurses homes and
ask the average person you want what you want to live like this and the average person was
saying now I don't want to be confined to bed I want to have dementia I don't be confused
about where I am I don't want to have somebody feed me soup and dribble down my chair and
and when you say I say will want to just get rid of all these people david you're talking about
euthanasia right he that level commanders no so now david help explain this to me you can
only be you can't be a little bit pregnant once you've decided to head down the path that
sometimes we should let other people decide to kill american citizens because they have they
got screwed up life now the messed-up year-old became want they can talk you can't throw a
ball so you know what why don't we just decide to check the amount david think about that
one a long time before you go there.

we're taking you behind the scenes here at our station... to tell you about a new campaign
we're launching. the reason - suicide is becoming a crisis in our region. it's an incredibly difficult
thing to talk about, not only for media organizations... but for all of us in our personal lives. but
something must be done. that's why nbc5 is launching 'in this together'. bob: I’m bob wise with
nbc5.for the past couple of years I’ve been talking with the dee anne everson, CEO of united
way of Jackson county about how we can educate our viewers about a rapidly growing crisis
facing our communities, suicide. how do we raise awareness, offer solutions and ultimately
help prevent these tragedies? then a few months ago I shared the vision with the staff at nbc5,
shortly afterwards the person you’re about to meet walked into my office and said she’d like to
be the spokesperson for this effort. after hearing her story dee anne and I actually tried to talk
her out of it; shed be putting herself in such a vulnerable position. we soon realized that this
was something she wanted to do for her own healing. please meet nbc5 news reporter blakely
mchugh. blakely: at a station staff meeting not long ago I was in the audience when our general
manager announced his intention to launch a region wide project to raise awareness of our
communities’ suicide crisis. I knew right away I wanted to be, I needed to be involved. when I
was 17 my dad took his life. I always knew he struggled with depression but I rarely remember
him being sad. he was always happy, cracking jokes, the life of the party; he always was the first
person to make others happy and he was the last person anyone expected to commit suicide.
7

Oregon’s suicide rate has increased almost 30% in less than 20 years; that statistic speaks for
itself and that’s why I asked if I could be the spokesperson for a massive community wide
initiative were calling in this together. our goal is three-fold; to communicate, educate and
prevent but there are many reasons why you should be involved, many ways you can help; for
me its personal, I’m doing it for my dad. who will you be doing it for? for more information

well you know I have a dog in the fight on this one I don't have any really direct personal
experience with suicide but when I see folks writing about rational suicide those two words put
in the same sentence rational so aside and perhaps society should start talking about calm
rational suicides versus irrational and suicide being treated as a terminal illness I’m not in favor
of suicide I actively opposed to a friend came to me and said I’ve been thinking about suicide I
would do what I could to talk them out of that I even do that for a stranger not even a friend so
I read this piece by Wesley smith about the focus on suicide prevention with eroding and help
medicine in the modern world is trying to find good reasons to say it's okay to commit suicide
Wesley welcome back to the program this is a stunning kind of you know argument that's being
made thank you Martha hello to your audience you know I’ve been covering the assisted
suicide euthanasia movement for 26 years which is pretty shocking to me because I never
expected to be involved in that and that issue this long I and over that time I have noticed that
he once a small bus commitment also cited his suicide prevention has been eroding and one of
the reasons for that I think h is the promotion of assisted suicide or foul on native promotional
sums to fight so once you accept the idea that not just to the side or euthanasia is an
acceptable answer to the difficulty of terminal only for her and some places disability him hello
motions but you're no longer an entire food inside society at most your name right thumb to
find a body she then all float the country's ecology social work etc there in the mental health
professions has been a majority but a growing view as you mentioned in the introduction that
comes to the floods or rational and those should not be imposed for a purpose so they need a
mental health professional or any rational suicide if they help with suicidal person go through
decision-making process that is an impulsive and that isn't just based on a whim that yeah for
these two-sided deem bad that affect mental health professional as rational I mean applying a
mental health professional own personal values and then that two sides would be permitted
and perhaps even facilitated the irrational food fight for to say a teenager who whose boyfriend
leaves her money she wants to kill itself should be imposed if say I am for them for example of
an irrational suicide she will also need a suicide prevention campaign becoming with some
exceptions obviously increasingly left they've all left because the media seemed less interested
in matter issue and more interested in be more provocative issue promoting assisted suicide
doing a story about suicide going away party like the new York times front page the l.a. times
has done and others and so you find yourself in a situation where I don't think we can call us
over and try to flood culture anymore knowing and to me Wesley and know people sometimes
tell me that I’m to black and white but hey I don't think you can be a little bit in favor of suicide
any more than you can be a little bit pregnant it's yeah either in favor of every or you're not and
8

once you start down that road is like the old church show joke about the young lady says your
show you're suggesting a prostitute nieces know we've already established that we're just
negotiating the price in this case you have a society that says well we used to be against all
suicides now orange were actually in favor of some of them but only the right ones and leave it
up to us the know these people I guess the people of society decide which ones are justified in
which one right and a goo for other think people would say well you can't be black and white
and everything is gray would never say that about smoking distance one example I also of
course we can be black and white there's nobody out this thing you know we would prefer that
you not small but if you decide to hope they use a filter cigarette that's not how you doing antismoking campaign you do an anti-smoking campaign with an unequivocal message that
smoking is bad for your health but it can cause cancer that makes you think and so forth the
same have to be true of suicide you cannot and of the idea here that we want to god this article
I wrote the national review you have and advocates are now saying well we shouldn't even call
it commit suicide because the term commits suicide imply that the forwards wrong we don't
wanna you know a good cause people stigma while you want to save people's lives you know
one of the things that saved the lives of our art is peer pressure the way people perceive that
they will be perceived if you turn some insight into just a choice like any other life decision
heard that and then we might make and you're going to end up with want people committing
suicide because they will not be restrained by the fear that they will that their decision will be
looked upon quarterly I just think that for abandonment and it's cool I think so too and I think
it's normal things something that is tremendously damaging especially it's on an issue where
the government has a dog in the fight the government and in especially if we were to go down
the path toward Medicare for all single payer of some other kind of foreign the government has
an incentive to see that as many people who are terminally ill or medically problematic that
would include mentally ill prop problematic where you could pour enormous resources into
trying to help a person with mental problems and still get no result the government has a dog in
the fight because they have a vested financial interest and seeing as many of those people go
away as possible specific example of the precise akerson what you just said euthanasia have
two of them at once legalized a few years ago by the supreme court of Canada all across the
country we're talking lethal injection euthanasia I Ontario bates table let the medical college
which is likely to carry medical association described the epic for doctors who wish to not
participate in killing patients based on religion conscience the beyond carrying medical college
she added that any doctor who passed by uniquely qualified patient to be killed month either
doing that you compel workers fell more engaged in what was called an effective full of I didn't
find a doctor that they know will be willing to kill another words every doctor in Ontario Canada
have to be complicit in euthanasia as part of team Europe professional doctor none makes no
sense at all you can read the whole piece in national review online Wesley smith is the author

it can be tough to navigate. thoughts of sadness is specially for kids. it's hard enough as adults.
so how can parents what children know? there is a safe place t about sad and uncomfortable
feelings I talked to one family counselor about the best ways to reach out when a child is sad or
depressed. often parents feel the pressure to immediately say or do the right thing. sometimes
parents get caught in wanting to find a solution right away because it's really hard when your
child comes to says that they're sad or depressed or in pain. I mean how could you not feel
some sense of wanting to make him feel better? licensed counselor rebecca francesconi says
the best action apparent can take his 1st listen and assess how deep the level of sadness really
is. so I think it's important for us to allow them the space to talk more about that. so some
things you can say or tell me more how can I be of help? is there anything that you need from
me? and those can be good starting points that to open a conversation she says we want to
teach our kids to be comfortable with their feelings. and those feelings can include sadness.
there are phrases to avoid. sometimes parents are very uncomfortable with people or

another great day and this greatest nation on god's green earth a great day despite the fact
that they are great national problem castle and increasingly harsh light on what many people
might describe as the american dream living in the great american west enjoying independence
and freedom and sometimes isolation and suffering according to every statistic available with
what can only be described as an epidemic of suicides it's an extraordinary thing lots of people
alarmed about what they see as a surging murder rate we don't have a rising murder rate we
do have are rising rate of gun violence why bcause of suicides and there's a remarkable article
it's been gaining a great deal of attention I think deservedly so is by steven roderick and it
appeared in rolling stone and the title of the article was all american I despair for the past two
decades a suicide epidemic has swept across the west with a middle aged white males dying in
record numbers stephen roderick is was something as depressing an alarming shocking as your
article months have to say congratulations but I think he made a real contribution to our
national discussion thank you for coming on the show of thanks for having me I hope you know
that was the key that would lead him to shine a light on first of all let's put the numbers in
perspective because it is it is utterly stunning the number of suicides fell last year they have
complete records is about 45000 it's more than double the number of murder yeah I think that
you mentioned at the beginning that I think that something that stunned the lot of people and
when you traded talk about gun violence and murder rate versus the how they read through
that much people die by their own hand and tribute to be to be skyrocketing guthrie its and end
what is shocking about this is how concentrated it is in numbers stage she focused a lot of
attention the article on wyoming montana you saw it away it won't but to just get right to it
and you make you make the point that if you just to look the white males who killed themselves
last year that it would be so many people the event you could accommodate them all madison
square garden right that that the nationwide great to have you know and it is an epidemic all
over the country but what we found was on the mound states we can talk a little bit of a wider
food the rates are even more just gap believe that it is even saying in california or new york or
whatever in a national problem but the mound they have been much worse than any other
region what's fascinating to me is that includes utah I what a lot of other health statistics we
cover this show before at very low alcoholism rates higher rates of family's stability utah does
pretty well a most measures of public health but all this one on suicides utah's or worse states
right yeah what I also think it's done i'm surprised by that for the reasons you just given our
people but yeah there's of you know compared to much of america very stable home life and
extended family and sense of community in you so you would think that and some of these
problems wouldn't hit them hard but some of the talk about the story while alcohol in the
museum a major contributing factor each case is different and in utah still in a very rural and
isolated and why I think it's getting better amount west still be aware I think it's harder to talk
about mental illness sorry you're feeling depressed in is maybe even stuff like that so I think all
that the tribute to you cod be right up there even though he said it doesn't have the alcohol
issues at hand you have the family bond king tighter there than most places in the country i'm
speaking with steven roderick his piece in rolling stone has posted up and rolling stone has
11

posted up our website it's pulled all american despair in utah just said to speak for a moment
about that state 85% of the gun deaths are suicides 85% which is just horrifying it's stunning
and injure peace it is heart breaking with this story is that you tell and you obviously are
enormously emotionally overwhelmed by doing this immersive reporting they were doing in
each of these cases.

for some of our high officials and government we could have some kind of fed droll suicide
prevention effort beyond what exists today that could probably save it u.s. made thousands of
lives I don't care where they are operating that kind of effort where it seems to be working well
that's the problem I think it could get I didn't look into it too much I think other countries are
doing to us but you can give me an example no one lewis places that want to you know
quintessential american west town of cheyenne wyoming and talking to people there who
trying to do suicide awareness said dick cheney's hometown both yeah the minute also just yet
here's the play that for 25 to 50000 dollars needed for our region of wyoming you could do all
kinds of psa news you could put up posters you can contact numbers they were trying to you
know put together a program you could put gunlock and then chopped could get for free which
basically take if you put a gun to take the it and your next 5 or 10 minutes to remove with
maybe a 5 to 10 minute makes you and save like and you know these states they're not there
they're the biggest but doing it and you know every state has a different budget problem or get
a budget issue and critically state in america west no pride themselves on low taxes and stuff
like that so getting one of these states to cough up your even a few 100000 dollars which and
you know because who you know less populated states could really make a difference truth is
really difficult and you know wyoming a state that had a dip and oil revenue or the price of oil
went down so in time I believe his 2017 they stripped out thee yelm money they were
providing for suicide awareness and the cheer because oil revenue a backup they put it back
and I obviously cannot he can cook them program going and if you're not sure or the funding
will come from and I think you know not to be long-winded about this enough to get to and
from the faith that the goal I have been subject to talk about him if you're going to fund it you
are talking about it and like we were and where could we use this money where the rate higher
fuel perini that we can take I think come you know talking to do whether they're academics or
people activists working to better awareness that fate of the path just over the past 10 or 15
years people become more comfortable talking about mental illness for confiding to people but
I do believe in that area in the mountain west goal is still very much a cowboy up individual in
show you on the prairie I you know I built my cabin you know I come from my own food
mentality that you even if it even if that kind of lifestyle this is still pending green generations
so very hard for someone to go to a neighbor or friends in haiti welcome having a problem
having you know what is called ddt led by the haitian more he made me think thing about it and
I think it's more difficult gaming state for him the other thing that connected to that is that
there is not the mental health personnel well I want I want to get that steven rogers deputies
we have spoken about this before his piece all american despair in rolling stone magazine this is
post our website and it's one of those pieces eventually can open your mind I think to have two
12

very very significant american problem I would imagine everyone was listening to this right at
this moment knows somebody or at least those of somebody who has been impacted by
suicide and weather itself a father or brother or sister cousin or queens it's one of those things
where it's a national epidemic right now and it seems to me that it did calls attention stephen
robert to a broader national epidemic which is undiagnosed mental illness because right now
we have a homeless problem I mean that is just the stadium all across the country the numbers
are unbelievable I just was hearing last week that the city of new york is spending 369 million
dollars a year trying to put homeless people in hotel rooms in hotel rooms I end though the
homeless epidemic is apple has a great deal to do with untreated mental illness v all the mass
shootings that we have virtually all of them that they don't have to do so much with terrorism
as they do with severe mental illness untreated and now at work when you talk about suicides
this especially aren't we better at being able to treat the kind of depression that often leads to
suicidal litigation I think I think we have we are whether it is medication or therapy dealer or
group talking and stuff like that I think we are I think the problem you on and trying to interrupt
too much into the issue of health insurance stuff like that but the other factor is that so many
people who do not have health insurance or have them without mental health aspect that you
know like I saw a lot of wyoming for people who reached their breaking point neither
attempted suicide or someone finally it took from the hospital on a lot of them are given these
72 hour holds or basically put in a room with other mentally ill people and given medication
heavy could nation you really and after the 72 hours each unit depending on the people I talk to
something you get a referral country you don't you're pretty much on your own and off their
often turn loose worse than when you came in and what is the islanders started men that talk
to you in a bad situation you're put in the street and you put in a room where you're
surrounded by 10 or 12 other mentally ill people could different it's that is not how exactly the
situation that is going to call you or inspire you that this life is worth living and you know I am
kind of you know it it's a really difficult thing in and if it's funny things they love I get on my
soap box the second rule if you want to do if you are somebody successful lori you're a member
of the middle class if you're someone who once to not worry about shooting nor the happening
that happening we do have to take better care of the underclass people who are less fortunate
I keep coming up that very quickly stephen because we are just about out of time but what's
the response to your piece which I think has attracted and well deserved a lot of attention you
know it's really been amazing from the fact that whether it's been through e-mail woes or
twitter direct messages or are other people passing on information I would say in the story
going up about a week ago I personally be another magnet receive more I personally receive
probably somewhere between 15 and 20 e-mails saying thank you from the worst thing you
know I lost my brothers the street to the but some of them are very hopeful like you know I
read the story and I know i've been feeling like this for the past year or two and gave me the
courage to talk to my wife about it that is the extra extraordinarily important because the first
thing to do in dealing with this problem like so many other problems is to focus on the
challenge and then maybe get together as a country as a community as family is to try to deal
with the pieces called all American I despair is an unforgettable piece of journalism by steven
roderick and I thank you for joining us on the show.

I want to begin this story with a note to following conversation about greg commuters new
movie film touches on the issue of suicide and may not be appropriate for all listeners it can
replace film a Portland dentist flocking through life when he sees a patient who seems To have
it all a happy family an interesting job then he hears the patient has taken his own life and Hill
becomes obsessed Michael this is a figure you all Wow me killed absolve find evidence of wide
the movie is Greg Kinnear directorial debut he started his on-camera career as a host of
humorous entertainment showed talks soup became famous for his roles in romantic comedies
like you've got mail the point a little miss Sunshine so I started off by asking why jump into
directing on the topic is difficult to suicide I kinda was kicking the tires of directing night had a
few stories that bounced around but it really wasn't until I was quite struck with steven majors
script he had a way of telling a dealing with the subject matter of suicide which had affected me
in my life there's people that were close to me and I found this script had a strangely lifeaffirming quality to it we talk about that the purchase to start drinking out of the game take on
a topic like this is no small thing can you talk about what your reservations were hit in taped
taking on the topic of suicide and how you thought you wanted to approach Yeah no big secret
there I mean I think anybody who has known anyone who took their life you know you're
shocked and sidelined by that there's always this nagging question why in the sense of people
who are you fought seemingly had good lives going and I guess that idea and that subject I had
always kind of stayed with me and this is all happening in a window of time where this issue of
societies you know clearly an epidemic fundamental lee the character of phil he believes
everyone is enjoying life in a way that he isn't haley and everyone has a better and how do you
think about that because I would think someone who is an actor radio Vatican a close-up view
of celebrity life which Peter tend to NV absolutely Um listen at there's another thing that
happened not know it's interesting when you think of the rise of these numbers and then you
think about the influence of social media and these gadgets that we carry around that basically
mirror the lives and incredible experience his whether they're real or not of those around us
what it can be healthy and there is an element of smoke and mirrors and a miss representation
and in the business side were candy and nuts part of the charm and Allamand it's one of the
defining qualities are just frankly I absolutely it is obviously a misrepresentation of the truth
because we all have you know complicated lives and there's the ups and downs but our
business in particular stands out as one that just shows off the he shot 80 glow of good things
there are times I think what you said I'm not an artist Hey there I'm guided see you always had
age John this view of this world for well we moved into the sweaty portion of that interview
where I have to lie down on the Couch I guess I've always felt a little bit like an outsider in the
business ou know it is strange that I was being walked away from talks shoot a film that I felt
out of place I mean I look around I do I think of the movie stars being so comfortable being
movie stars and there's people were very comfortable that very good at it and I wouldn't say
that i've necessarily having a great knack for when I think of view as a character actor think of
some of the characters you've played as the actor over the years what has been your type like
how you been boxed in at times and and how do you try and play against it I certainly coming
out of you know sabrina and early movies was offered a lot of smiley romantic comedies and I
14

probably did more than I should have when I started I don't know you know listen i'm a scotch
irish and I want to fight everything that I might tell medical left I want to go right if they're going
right I want to go laugh I think i've just inherently kicked and bopped the other way and when
there was a clear path for me I got uncomfortable I still feel that way fundamental lee film I
made this movie is about a person who is looking back who's trying to make sense of things are
you at that point in your life and if so how are you feeling about it well life I feel very good
about it I had just had a birthday and I have 3 daughters wonderful wife and obviously my
career is important as well but when you ask me when I look back generally my happy that
however further move these tv shows things that I might live to regret it of course but that's
never where my mind goes I tend to go to my life and engender early life I feel like i've been
incredibly fortunate and incredibly lucky well gregg peter thank you so much for speaking with
us telling us about this film and talking a little bit about your career, thank you very much and
we want to know if you or someone you know may be considering suicide contact the national
suicide prevention lifeline at one 802.3 8 to 5 5 or the crisis text line.

we also talked about this before I was 22 on veterans were committing suicide every day I hope
that the number is on the decline what is the v.a. doing to contact these folks in and help them
get through it is dealing with so the good thing is once again the president has focused on us
he's talked about it I just kicked off the president's executive task force on suicide prevention
the just before began talking with you what we're doing is creating a whole help approached
this one of the tragedies that exists out there 20 veterans a day to take realize 14 of those 28
are not in the v.a. system we have to find them what the president wants me to do was open
the aperture when it comes to grants and cooperation with the private sector so that we get
charities involved week at no non-governmental organize old we get tribal government to gold
so that we can go and find these people but I will say this if if we just look at the last tragic act
in a veteran's life we're not going to get very far we have to concentrate in my view and i'm not
a medical professional i've spent my entire life and defense we afternoon get our arms around
mental health issues we're not even at us but mix stage when it comes to have me what goes
on in the brain and I will tell you we're not going to be able to prevent all of these that the
human foot with the human heart the human condition is such that you just never know will
happen while giving example Cleveland so last month a veteran took his life for our property he
was in his 60s he was living with his mother he was looking had surgery that would have
resulted in the removal of an ally of his vocal cords and his jaw and it he didn't want to live like
that it so he left this note on our property saying please take care my mother those kinds of
things that no matter what we do just the natural flow of human life will dictate it we can't stop
all of that all there would be no way to know that that had a short but what's the system now
i'm secretary when somebody leaves the of the armed forces there now veteran they serve us
they've been in in places like you fathom variety of time what does the process h him I think
you have a nice life I got to be somewhat medicare afterwards they come to us and they get an
immediate mental health screening so since this fiscal year began on October first we've had
900000 new veterans come into the system paul 900000 of those have been strained for
15

mental health issue of those 900000 we're following day every with 3000 who have given us an
indication that they may want to harm themselves or the tricks and pitfalls of this is o that 20
veterans to take their lives we know hat more than half of them have never had a mental
health diagnosis syrians shown indications that have mental health issues so it is now
mandatory that when you come to us but you get a mental health screening for us that's the
first step in the second is if you go to a murky hunt began not too far away here's and you say
you have an issue we have same-day mental health appointments maps for everyone they
didn't write them do yeah and even even though those who perceive other than honorable
discharges I know being a military city there everybody is listening to you knows what that
means this president has told us we have to reach out to them we contacted 500 1000 service
members receive another inaudible this card and said if you could you feel the to have an issue
please come to us now and the other folks who are the folks who was we also know that in
many cases and other than honorable discharge means you did something wrong on the
military but we're looking for those who may have been discharged because no one recognized
that they may have had a brain injury or traumatic experience overseas was not caught it is a
secretary robert wilkie so for those listening right now and look at that time was short I
appreciate you taking some time with me and great axes as always for those listening to don't
think they have health care i've heard from military veterans alive who said there's nothing
available be pags 8 and mi it tends to be yes there is what they do know about the mission act
the program well elects but just talk about those who feel they're in crisis there's a number and
I will repeat for you it's 100 to 7.8 to 5 life if the press one they will talk to someone and unlike
some of the criticisms that we received from those who oppose this president there is no voice
mail on this system the average wait time for a live body shape second and coal that number
the other thing they need to do is just call in touch just say san antonio call on murphy I called
them and asked for information and have someone to walk them through what they need to
get me the issue that you raised it is one that we are still working on the problem is not with
veterans who were already in the system those in the system the wait times at v.a. are as good
or better than any in the private sector across this country is for those who are new to the
system one of the reasons the president signed the mission attackers allowed me to create
standards if you can get a new appointment within a certain number of days is then we give
you over to the private sector to get that cares quickly his posh so they need to cold call abyei
call this crisis mind of someone answer it's it will have them do that one last quick one end and
shortages of we follow very generous question I apologize why in your opinion did get so bad
was bad leadership the v.a. I we have veterans dying waiting

george film it was called the craziest and in the movie the crazy people we're dealing with bouts
of insanity I remember the 2010 version there's a guy and he walks on to the little league
baseball diamond with a gun and he's just 4 days he's got this huge gun just think there is and
the police officer said the game says okay bill and looks up at him kind of days look at bill you
okay and then build without thinking raises the rifle and police officer gunned down right in
front of kids a pretty powerful scene in the film s remake the georgia dome the craziest but you
16

know it doesn't stop there okay drains behaviors in this town lou goes from people who want to
harm others to suicides and then there were others to part who also took part in murder and
rioting was almost like you know that no one knows why was telling each other that was crazed
out freaking out well all the film eventually revealed that an external force was responsible for
these actions I can't help but think were now living anatoly or something internal something
sociopathic and strange is haunting people's minds early in the morning of april 14 28 team
david buckle a 60 year-old retired gay rights attorney left his cozy garden surrounded brooklyn
house and walked to a nearby prospect park he made his way to a stretch of grass or email
media outlets a statement decrying humanities facility the face of pollution and global warning
a few minutes later he doused himself with gasoline and set himself on fire in his email he
wrote quote most humans on the planet now breathe air be unhealthy by fossil fuels and many
die early deaths as a result its email went on to say quote my early death by fossil fuel reflects
what we are doing to ourselves and quote now what's weird is a characteristic care it also
looked short notice the scene for emergency personnel you wrote i'm david buckle and I just
killed myself by fires protest suicide and then wrote I apologize to you for the mass know
unbuckle family friends were aware of his intent and we'll never know for certain whether preexisting mental distress may have contributed to his decision to take his life like he's writing
made it clear he viewed his death in political terms and hoped it would galvanize bas action
buckle had died with that in mind buckle the glitter distinguished legal career he worked on
famous cases including nebraska hate crime it inspired the film boys don't cry for that reason as
well as the shocking circumstances of his death his death received national news coverage
but in a reactive 24-hour news cycle we have the 24-hour news cycle we have the story was

david buckle set fire to himself a park in new york saying i'm dying because that would pop
fossil fuels my body and is what i've done i'm sorry for the mass then we have this woman in
florida him stab yourself 3 times the police show up she says I did this because i'm tired of
trump i'm tired of living in this country with trump so I am I seeing this pattern before and his
long before donald trump as president okay I seen this is another guy and course it's hard
himself in kansas I think we're seeing a pattern and a on is this is nothing new to me during
grounds allow inspected 2010 I inform my audience of secret suicide pact among climate and
climate change advocates said that there's a suicide pact a lot of people believe they should
remove their carbon footprint they go voluntarily and encouraging others to say this is
something happened back in 2010 I do all it influence that one maybe in a statement buck all
maybe there are few people that committed suicide because of global warming but one of the
things that I am reported by sided be there was a 7 month old survived for 3 days alone with a
bullet in the chest after being shot by her parents as part of a suicide pact over fears of global
warming francisco's shero and miriam colletti shop their daughter and her toddler brother
before killing themselves their two year-old son francisco died instantly after being hit in the
back however their unnamed daughter cheated death that the bullet from her father's handgun
this true vital organs think about that for a moment these people are so afraid of global
17

warming that they want they have suicide pact that killed jo they attempt to kill the family
father mother kids also read a story in the details but it was a guy who we used to drink water
because he said that if he drank the water he would be giving up or taking resources from
people who need it because of global warming and because of how resources are scarce now
clyde people unstable and know that these people did tell me about david buckle he was a
lawyer a smart lawyer a very good lawyer who just one day up and said okay i'm for gas my
body i'm ady they go to the the he basically walked took into a park part gas says a bonfire and
kind of casually walk through the park no screaming yelling know-nothing walking through the
park the woman stabbing yourself say has stab myself isn't tired of trump tower living in this
country now I need to see irene lot of things so all this craziness going on in the world right now
democrats are planning to host the capitol hill event featuring psychiatrists warned president
trump is unfit for office space in his mental health the event will be led by dr. bandy lee a yale
school of medicine psychiatrist it editor of the dangerous case of donald trump both fit argues
psychotic is like I have the responsibility according to the book to warn the public what a
president is dangerous al course this is this is a very controversial position because psychiatric
associations urged members never to diagnose patients they person evaluate saying it
undermines the scientific rigor the profession so all these psychiatrist showing up to try and
prove it prove that trump is crazy this is is the attack is a very tacky move I think but course dr
lee and others who agree with her stance say their description of the president's behavior of
showing mental instability in dangerousness should be interpreted as an issue for diagnosis isis
instead he got mental instability going on he's dangerous i'm trying to figure how dangerous
cnn's but what has he done so dangerous evening we haven't gotten word is there's been no
war really he's been trying to negotiate with people I know what he's done is so dangerous but
they're saying he's dangerous he's crazy he's unstable many clinicians political commentators
members of the public the speculated upon to help president trump and over 7070 1000

in the last hour I was talking about a movie I once saw is georgia remember film maybe they
didn't 2010 I believe it's called the crazy is where all of a sudden people started dealing with
bouts of insanity and deranged behaviors like suicides another took part in murder in writing no
one knew why they found some external reason why i'm on the way what was his secret but
what's odd is that i'm seeing some of the same behavior going on right now something
sociopathic something strange something haunting isil a him and you know we see a pattern
you have to talk about these I have to talk about on this program because any patterns some
the when his stick out to me I want to figure out what it's like trying to figure out why they
happened when they happen and and what is motivating this happen so I did a story last hour
about david buck whose 6 year-old retired gay rights attorney what his got up one day got
dressed walked out of his brooklyn house walked to a nearby park slope prospect park it made
its way to stretch of grass he e-mailed media outlets and he said the statement and that
statement basically was cry it was decrying humanities passive in the face of pollution global
warming and then he basically sat down poured gas on himself and he set himself on fire don't
18

email he wrote most humans on the planet now breathe air made unhealthy by fossil fuels and
he died early guesses result is he went on to say my early death by fossil fuel reflects what we
are doing ourselves it was weird about the whole thing is he's he left a note to the first
responders mursi first personnel it said I am david buckle and just kill myself by fires protest
suicide wrote I apologize to you for the mess alba family did not know what motivated him it
away did it and distinguished legal career many do we was and they were hoping I guess he was
hoping he would start some you know grew he was saying he was a martyr for global warming
but no in the 24 hour news cycle he got lost somewhere between a molar investigation
bombing Syria soul he did pretty much didn't make a difference and we have a guy a few days
ago was the lives in Washington d.c. and people are shocked and horrified because he went
into the park set himself on fire in front of their eyes as they are now grouped he walked across
the open part is calmly set fire himself walked calmly down the parkway the lips right in
Washington see mall secret service officers as well as u.s. park police officers rushed to
extinguish the flames they administered emergency aid but 85% of his body burned so in the
dying but what bothers me is that if you go online uses takes walking calmly through the park
on fire but nothing was bob no screaming no help me walking calmly always burning it's not
clear like coup that took his own life tmz claimed he was on the loose the ginza something days
later a passenger car to the southwest traffic win kansas city douse himself acres scene and
himself on fire according to police no motive cited some say was a political move but course he
was sent to the hospital critical condition at a florida woman stabbed yourself 3 times with a
kitchen knife told responding officers the president trump was to blame a officers found the
unidentified woman standing outside her home in palmetto florida leading former has legs and
face according to a partially redacted report she does because she said she was tired trump his
presidency tired of a country and in heat this this is what we're seeing we're seeing this pattern
is nothing new I mean there are people who've committed suicide others a suicide pact and
family in argentina where a father a mother killed children killed one of their children the other
ship child survived because they were afraid of the end of the world in global warming and
what's ironic about all this is that there's going to be this big display in Washington d.c. where
they're going to bring in a doctor about any of the bad lesions from the yale school of medicine
your book called the biggest case of donald trump I heard a bunch of other psychiatrist will
come into Washington to analyze president trump's behavior he was mentally ill there are
about 70000 signatures from mental health professional saying they wish they would do
something to investigate his his mental help but that the irony is that why don't they look at the
people that are committing these acts just bizarre and wise happy I believe there's a lot of
things at stake here once again to go back to the ugliness of identity politics and the war and its
eu people call the idea trump syndrome okay trump derangement syndrome the syndrome
right but they don't they it's kind of a folk word they're using for the times but as he's scary
going on here no one really understands what is going on you look at what's happening in
england right now you look at what a president trump showed up for the day that the queen
and and all these things that were going on and they were getting all the faces of people were
there to see trump they have they have trump maybe balloon never in my life the scenes such
rockets behavior dangerous behavior for one man so we look at this as a glow as a growing
trend we look at this is you know because people to serve in distressed by a lot of things a
policy of speech behavior a all these things are a factor I believe and identity politics the idea
19

into crisis we're having right now what's interesting is that I was able to get screening copy
david likes to film about his life called renegade and it starts with bikes beginnings how has
been the target for censorship and of course he is speaking engagements in castle but had a lot
of inspiration inspirational things to say about something called label consciousness it reminded
me of what I have to talk about with regard to their identity crisis of identity war we all know
david I guess he's prodding english writer public speaker he's worn during hajj his lifetime he
was first football players footballer passport broadcaster and later became a conspiracy
researcher and author and he still holds a profile you hold it well the green party politician an
activist I exchange life change 99 he was cited told he was sent to heal the earth despite strong
criticism and mockery I has been well received a lot to read his books and aimless psoriasis say

We also talked about this before the goes 22 veterans were committing suicide per day I hope
the numbers on the decline what is the v.a. doing to contact these folks and help them get
through it as they deal with so the good thing is once again the president has focused on us he's
talked about it I just kicked off the president's executive task force on suicide prevention the
just before began talking with you right thumb what we're doing is creating a whole help
approached this one of the tragedy that exist sell beer at the 22 veterans a day to take him alive
14 the most money are not in the v.a. system we have to find them what the president wants
me to do is opening the aperture when it comes to cramps and cooperation with the private
sector so that we get charities involved we get no other non-governmental organize and all we
get tribal government and bald so that we can go out and find these people but I will say this if
if we just look at the last tragic act in a veteran's life we're not going to get very far we have to
concentrate in my view i'm not a medical professional i've spent my entire life and defense we
have to get our arms around mental health issues but we're not even at the sputnik stage when
it comes to grabbing what goes on in the brain and I will tell you we're not going to be able to
prevent all of these that the human of the human heart the human condition is such that you
just never know what will happen to be an example Cleveland last month veteran took his life
for our property he was in his 60s he was living with his mother that he was looking at the
surgery that would have resulted in the removal of an ally of his vocal cords in his jaw it and he
didn't want to live like that us so he left this note on our property saying please take care of my
mother but those are the kinds of things that no matter what we do just the natural hello
human life will and penny we can't stop all of that will there be no way to know that the event
had a short but what would the system now i'm secretary when somebody leaves the 8th of the
armed forces there now veteran they serve us they've been in places that I can't even fathom
friday citing what does a process it can thank you have nice life right got to be some within the
care afterward come to us and they get an immediate mental health screening so since this
fiscal year began on October first we've had 900,000 new veterans come into the system all
900000 of those have been screened for mental health issues of those 900,000 we're following
20

day nearly 3,000 who have given us an indication that they may want to harm themselves well
all the tricks and pitfalls of this is that old the 20 veterans to take their lives we know that more
than half of whom have never had a mental health diagnosis certainly shown indications that
have mental health issues so it is now mandatory it when you come to us but you get a mental
health screening for us about the first half and the second is if you go to audit murphy began
not too far from where you're sitting and you say you have and issue we have same-day mental
health appointments that's for everyone they get it right then lou yeah and even those who
perceive other than honorable discharges and I know being a military city there everybody is
listening to he wrote this president has told us knows what but we have to reach out to them
we've contacted 500000 servicemembers receive another inaudible discard and said if you
could you feel the urge to have an issue please come to us now and the other folks who are the
folks who it was we also know that in many cases and other than honorable discharge means
you did something wrong in the military but we are looking for those who may have been
discharged because no one recognized that they may have had a brain injury or traumatic
experience overseas was not caught it is secretary Robert Willkie so for those listening right
now on another but time is short I appreciate you taking some time would be great axes as
always for those listening who don't think they have health care I’ve heard from military
veterans a lot who said there's nothing availability pags in my intense debate yes there is what
they do that what about the mission happen in the well let's just talk about those who feel they
are in crisis there's a number and I will repeat for you if it's 100 to 7.8 to 5 5.

during last night's show we spoke with the st. superintendent of public instruction chris ragdoll
about the increasing rates of teen suicide and what schools and communities can do to support
struggling students. here we think the schools are obviously a critical part of this family
recognition of this. so a larger awareness of what suicide risk looks like. how do you intervene.
how do you engage a young person who's at risk. and of course, the schools are one of the
great places to do that because we have them for six to eight hours a day. we have trained
professional is there a first line of intervention. but even when we train enough folks in our
schools and add more counselors and support staff there have to be community resources
when you refer a young person in crisis to get significant support and help. there has to be
something in the community because that's not the expertise schools were a first line identifier
and then we have to deliver that that that person that child. so it's not just beefing counseling
and mental health in schools it's also making sure that our community mental health systems
are strong? that is a partnership between local government and the state and we also spoke to
22

right all about funding for earthquake ready schools as well as the shift away from standardized
testing for students. you can hear that full interview on our web site that is 213 foxconn.

story line for so here's a baby in 1000 oaks California as a transgender grandchild knees had
mutilating surgery is on hormones he acts 16 although 26 28 am sorry years old and comment
any have made that I can only say this would mean in capturing transgendered kid him a dope
at that otherwise would not leave because they're pushing this and saying that gender
hormones and surgery and people should never been done many of these individuals need
credit yet cookers psychological counseling from something that happened jon mike I can't
believe that we are so touched do they do allow this to continue the should be how
amendments out it's back to what Jeff was just stupid we have a chance to find it's insidious a
good one barber in Minneapolis can you speak to the claimed high suicide rate among
transgender teens and she's heard that surgery did not help the suicidal thoughts the salute
two separate issues quickly yeah this suicide if you are going to continue because transitioning
and not condemned syriza think about suicide prevention and what we're finding out is that
rebuilding the problem and that's why the suicide rates near 19 more times likely to commit
suicide after transition interview just stayed the same and dealt with their missions in that cycle
there while awarding I didn't know that even before the same they would be correct that wall
really something Michael in los Angeles wonders why we are so quick to change the physical

it is a real pleasure right now to hold off all the phone calls and talk to dr build software who is
a medical doctor and national director of physicians for compassionate care education
foundation professor and dr. it's good to have you on the program was great to be on the
program it's always great to talk with and made an energetic well I do my best I want to point
out you're not you're not just a doctor you're also teach and then you advocate for
compassionate care and the reason we have to do that is Oregon made history us some time
ago for being the first government on planet earth to form only indoors doctor-assisted suicide
and now the state is considering a change the law and dr. correct me if i'm wrong this change
would literally make it legal for doctors to starve a patient to death that correct absolutely get it
done fine category of individual would be fair game for us to neglect with respect the basic food
hydration of this whole movement of so-called voluntary stopping of eating and drinking is
expanding having conferences the close with seattle Washington where the entire conference
23

and dedicated to the expansion a situational killing at the end of life you know you couldn't do
that to a dog or cat or worse without being arrested by were advocating now that patients with
Alzheimer’s these the campaign at some point earlier in their life I had out of fear of thought
they might not be able to have a dignified and quote life they've taken check the box and then I
get back upon where dr. health care drivers the nursing home but early stops helping them to
eat and stop giving them food nutrition that they need I used the term bastrop be tube or
whatever else that it's too eli and most of this dr. crick and for wrong is going to apply to
patients who are Alzheimer’s or dementia sufferers correct burma category really broad you
know you're asking me to beyond caught me read the 29 page bill very closely and the reality is
that we're talking very objectively if your so-called close the dow well how do you find that can
bob people should have the right to kill himself the fed the cure the limb because after all they
had more worse suffering so it and by the way that's one category it is intolerable suffering so
among the 4 different categories opposed to death one of them advance progressive illness
that would be like all timer marriage perhaps oh well exactly what could be diabetes we mean
you no harm with you I know that there are many hard to be patient you have left life prognosis
for typically then patients with cancer so you know the reality is categories are really in broad
extraordinary suffering well you know that that happened for people who are proud of the fact
you know today in Canada there's a person petitioning to be because he it like kids and
powerful ready I young man a thon of a father who unfortunately it is I think and colluding with
the thunder offense a definite about life and rather than trying to work on a new innovative
ways to approach whatever pain he might out the father thing yeah I mean he's right he should
he should end his life should be allowed under canon law to can do life with euthanasia even
and so the tension that gives him a glock by the progressive movement course of is for
happening all over the world whether it's now the lender can and even here in Oregon and you
know I heard you know our senate and house was pushing to expand from a prediction of 6
months to live patrol month to have because they were trying to include measures that lou gary
station they'll patients who might have difficulty swallowing if you wait I swallow a deadly
potion if he waited until 6 months only what had a lot of that money because the turn that
large you know and we don't have a crystal ball reading course of the medical school and what
doctors really loud he get predicting how long the person globalism I would have an anecdote
about them i'm a pran because the relative or a loved one who is now very much alive after
they were told they would be gone and in just 4 months and in my own life with told were with
her advanced cancer and getting incurable cancer that she had 3 to 9 months 11 thankfully we
were blessed with port times that much life before she died naturalism at home with big thing
in any and all those words deliberately because they're co-opted by the movement and you
know the only thing you can do to change people thinking they use euphemisms about the
situation of killing a massive overdose of that he one not even the end of life based on the bill
those bills including anyone who doesn't feel good about their life and one professor just to put
a point on this bill was apparently inspired by the case nor harris' nor harris had Alzheimer’s
and twenty-sixteen her husband asked a court to order the nursing home she was and to stop
providing food and water now she wasn't being provided with to the no food down nasal
gastric tube sure knows the nursing home was feeding air with this bone I mean their food with
feeding your real food and they said it was up to her whether she wanted to either not she
indicated in an advance directive that she didn't want to give an artificial nutrition but
24

apparently this bill would allow doctors to say don't get many water don't get many food even
if they take it by hand by copper bottom or straw right well absolutely it that that is absolutely
correct and unfortunately I don't know whether more was eliminated by a court decision not to
move on without them but the reality of it could be and people I know my mother and you
know got a lesser god rest her soul she had waxing and waning with her dementia it at the end
of her life and her big time should be very loose it in your checked the box like nor apparently
did better with the claim that she did or suddenly you know terri schiavo's husband remembers
she would wallet this way ou are fair game because you at this point you've been declared
unable incompetent to respond for you I want your ears open and he eliminated the patient's
choice that's supposedly can help people a choice that you have a choice now but the reality is
that the film loosely written anything but your definition something I don't you read the
definition for the military to take home means not incapable what you heard that people are
able to start killing your sort through definition a minute it it's remarkable and you look at what
we mind kate bowl while I get it it's whatever the doctors that well it could be a doctor a good
match to back pain who takes on face value what the so-called loved one might think about the
person they're confident the and hehe without any court decision could beat up the person to
adjudicate that yeah okay what's wrong food water and the family has said that the person is a
loose made a dent and gone away it just you know the courts decided in nor his favor that she
could keep feeding they decided against her husband's request the should be starved to death
and but apparently this bill would change that it would say if you decide to start someone to
death who's not even capable of communicating or expressing their wishes on the family can
decide to start a family member did have I can't believe we've reached this point where you
might take somebody in the most vol one of those vulnerable positions they could ever be at a
suffering from Alzheimer’s dementia and say I am the family views this as a kindness so just cut
off food water and they will eventually die probably fairly quickly you're absolutely right and
you know unfortunately the elder abuse lawyers will work well for trying to defend a people
alive I only know one of the elders in the country are viewed it and the ultimate abused by a
family member would be and the ever eliminating the life of the person using a new law dr
tough words a pleasure thanks so much for your time today well glad to be on i'm glad you're

The Yakima county coroner's office performed an autopsy earlier today on the body found in a
freezer in toppenish last week. But investigators still don't know who it is - or if the person is
male or female. the body was found in a freezer in an area of Toppenish sources say is used as
an unofficial dumping ground for garbage. cocurtice said they'll now have to rely on dental
records to identify the person. if that doesn't work, they'll try to find a d-n-a match, which could
take quite a while. an autopsy earlier today found that an inmate at the Yakima municipal jail
died of self-inflicted asphyxia. last week, the 48- year-old man was found unconscious in his
cell.....he died shortly after at a local hospital, in what authorities say was a suicide. the man

drowning in debt. and it's costing some of them their lives. thank you for joining us... i'm
chynna greene kezi 9 news reporter emma jerome joins us to break down the troubling
statistics and she also spoke with local vets about this ever-growing issue. emma jerome: "in
january the cdc released a study that found suicide rates in veterinarians are much higher
compared to the general population." lisa poquette: "i have staff to pay I have rent to pay I
have medication bills to pay..." lisa poquette has been a veterinarian for over 25 years and says
the burnout rate has climbed exponentially since she began. poquette says the suicides could
also be due to the amount of student debt vets have when they leave school. she also says the
emotional toll of being a vet is heavy. lp: "i've counseled people& I am not a counselor& but i've
helped counsel people who need to get help & if you won't do it for you do it for your pet" she

In tonight's health alert.. the stress of the job is taking its toll. emma jerome: "katie holland has
been a vet tech for 8 years. her drive and passion to become a veterinarian is there... but she
tells me there are factors that have stopped her from going that route katie holland: "the cost
of vet school is really high and the average student comes out with crippling debt" according to
the American veterinary medical association -- people who have a passion for helping pets will
graduate 143 thousand dollars in debt. kh:" the average student is in their 60s before they'll
have their vet school paid off" their median salary... at about 88 thousand. kh: "i did really want
to go to vet school but I decided to go another route because of the cost" holland says that's
just part of the reason vets arFe burning out at such a high rate. she says they're overworked...
and that can lead to depression and anxiety. a new report found the suicide rate in male
veterinarians is two times higher than the general population... for women veterinarians... it's
three and half times higher. ej: "compassion fatigue... it's not really understood but it plays a
huge role in the burnout rate for veterinarians and technicians alike. at 6 find out what it is and

Now on kezi 9 news at six... lots of debt and compassion fatigue... both are piling up for
veterinarians -- putting them at an increased risk for suicide. the numbers, in tonight's top
story. child welfare advocates are making their voices heard -- after a judge threw out the
sentence of convicted murderer angela mcanulty. the latest in the controversial decision -coming up. tsunamis remain a major threat for cities on the Oregon coast... and four key words

with more on that disturbing new study from the u-s government --- showing an alarming
suicide rate among veterinarians. and it appears to be getting worse. good evening... i'm matt
templeman and i'm chynna greene in for renee. kezi 9 news reporter emma jerome sat down
with local veterinarians and brings light to these troubling new findings in tonight's top story.
katie holland: "veterinarians have the difficulty of taking care of animals but also running a
business and also having really big hearts because that's why they want to do this type of work"
for most people... being a veterinarian sounds like a lot of fun. what could be stressful about
working with cute animals all day? it turns out --- a lot. emma jerome: "2.1. male veterinarians
are over 2 times more likely to commit suicide compared to the general population and for
women it's even worse&.with a rate that's 3.5 higher than the national average" one factor is
what's called "compassion fatigue." veterinarians can't help every animal... and they can

29

euthanize up to five animals a day. lp: "we love everything. we want to help everything, and we
can't" lisa poquette has been in this field for 25 years. she's said the financial stress is also
tough. lp: most of us are not getting rich&. I probably make less than most of my clients... on
average... veterinarians are leaving school nearly one hundred and fifty thousand dollars in
debt and raking in about 88 thousand dollars a year to show for it both poquette and holland
want this new study to bring light to encourage those in this field to prioritize their own mental
health and well-being kh: "practicing self-care is really important." they both say that at the end
of the day they hope their clients can offer them the same understanding that they affer their

right now, Spokane police are putting some new skills to the test... in the hopes of making our
community a better place. as part of the national "one mind campaign"... police are
implementing new resources and going through new training... focused on helping officers deal
with mental health emergencies. before we sent peter maxwell out to breaking news... he got
the details. one year ago, the police department took the 4-part pledge... created by the
international association of chiefs of police. they had to set up a partnership with a mental
health organization... make a plan for how officers deal with someone going through a mental
health crisis. train officers and staff in mental health first aid ... and put them crisis intervention
31

training. over the years the job... officer john o'brien says it's become clear... these are
necessary elements for their daily duties as a police officer. we are coming across more people
suffering from mental illness. some of them use illegal drugs as well at the same time. so we're
having to wear many hats when we encounter them. by no means are we psychologist or
psychiatrists but we're having to understand what they're suffering from and what they're
experiencing." any given month spokane police respond to more than 500 calls for services
meaning requests to check on people... helping someone who is suicidal... or having a mental
health crisis. on average... officers say they take almost 90 people to the hospital for mental
health issues... every month. instead of taking them to jail... part of the partnership with
frontier behavioral health... through the pledge campaign... means officers can steer people
into a program that can help them. when it comes to their new crisis intervention training...
officers have learned to how make a tense situation go from 100... to zero. "we hope that these
programs will give officers new tools and new techniques to help deescalate situations.
therefore, bringing the community to a safer location and helping the people suffering from the
mental illness into a safer outcome." s-p-d plans to have all of their officers go through the 40
hours of crisis training in the near future. another part of the partnership between spokane
police and frontier behavioral health... is that an expert from frontier rides along with an officer
on duty... to be there to help with any mental crisis or situation.

we want to check in now on an incredible story that has for friends transfixed it seems as many
as 19 employees a giant telecom company committed suicide a decade ago 12 more attempted
suicide now judges are deliberating whether their bosses should go to prison for pushing them
over the edge in the trial the rap last week in Paris 7 former executives of what was the state
run France Telecom stand accused of making more miserable for job protected state employees
in order to get rid of them after being forced by the state to become the private profit based
company Oranje and obviously and our correspondent in paris has been watching this L and this
is shocking because it is cleaner those that took their lives at least try to communicate that it
was because of the work place there's no confusion about that Yeah exactly Robin it's very very
32

disturbing cases the first case where buses have been put on trial for moral harassment but
over the last two months we've seen all the family members and fellow employees of the
people took their last take the stand and just read countless story of just the misery that that
went on there and so even know people can be shot that why would you kill yourself over job it
did seem that there was some terrible practices being put in place cutthroat tactics to Chase
people Wow it's one of those who took their lives Nicholas friend Indiana kills himself and his
company T-shirt hate his suicide note read I can't stand this job anymore and the company can
care less on an act Offered can for all the things you talk about some of the things that were
alleged to be happening to these workers yellow failing they had you know like you said it was
the state telecom company was just a statement not only then it went to full competition total
tech revolution in technology you know is that at&t days France Telecom publicly traded on the
stock exchange said the whole environment changed and so they have to get rid of 22000
employees tube to start becoming profitable and that actually the CEO was overheard saying
any of course regret these remarks later that he was going to cut staff and he would people
would go either by the door or the windows so the things they did were for example I would
move people one woman was moved 3 times in one year be no different places across france
and you know sometimes the spouse could follow but you can always find a job said this whole
family pick up and go forward I can not move people were forced to change jobs for example
one very quiet very good phone line technician was forced to take a sales job in front of people
office said with absolutely no training and then people were paraded by their bosses and put
down any of these a lot of these people had been there for decades and they did this job was
part of their identity so just completely destabilizing for them you mentioned former CEO D Ill
barge saying in 2007 he reached this these layoffs by the window or the door a woman did
throw herself out her office window one man in the latest himself and his daughter haley
testified in the trial in turn to these former CEO or officials and said when you killed my father
any who are the French reacting today strong well you know it's shocking eat you think now
why would you kill yourself over job but now as we said these were people of a certain age
would spend their careers in these jobs and so you know but on the other hand people urges
they're horrified by that but there's a lot of sympathy for the families because they lost loved
ones because of of management practices and it's absolutely shocking you know in Europe
there's a different expectation from capitalism no it's not accept the ball here to fire workers
said its shareholders can get higher dividends you know if your company is making money why
are you firing people and putting families told families in peril so there's another view of
capitalism here and people are just even though it is extreme to kill yourself over a job and
perhaps this would happen today frances changing people still have much sympathy for the
families that were destroyed by management explained little bit more because it's also much
tighter labor market 8 ds these were state protected jobs it was a job for life we used to have
them in the United States like 40 50 years ago so there was an expectation that you would
devote yourself to the company was your family but didn't there aren't many jobs know well
the thing is you know some of these people were of a certain age others age discrimination
everywhere and in a lot in france they didn't have a modern skills you know Yes the French job
market is notoriously rigid is it's hard to get fired here harder than in the U.S. people look at us
thank you can just be fired litter early just thrown out and you can guess people are just
horrified by that but it is harder to get fired is a harder to find jobs employers they don't want
33

higher on an upswing because they're scared they'll never be able to get rid of employees on a
downswing one risk is that Hey they have been forced from for these huge payouts they had to
pay off employees in labor court but this is changing President I call is trying to loosen up the
labor market said it you know people can move more quickly if they did get fired they can get
another job and it is starting to become a lot Economic reforms to boost growth we've been
looser to this situation I don't think watching the the yellow vest protest there's you would see
today well but he goes changes that Obama is trying to there's strikes so this trial comes in
make are pretty contentious you know these the middle of this resistance to changing the
economy even though you say might be better for the work in the long run media it does Rob
and the thing is you know france many people applied and macro changes and he pushed
through changes with mean not even up people from the unions you is sort of rally but nobody
expected something bigger was like Wow he won but you're right then can the yellow estimate
so it is a divided country.

with news of another troubling death involving suicide from a city parking garage. thank you for
joining us. i'm Chynna Greene. kezi 9 news reporter emma jerome joins us live from downtown
with more information in tonight's top story. chynna... i'm here at the overpark in downtown
Eugene where at 1 am yesterday morning... Eugene police tell me a 40-year-old woman walked
to the top of this structure and then jumped off... taking her own life... now we don't usually
report on suicides, but this is the second time in 6 months that someone has taken their life
from this structure. back in February a man died after jumping from the same garage during
afternoon rush. while there is a concrete barrier to keep people from accidentally going over
the edge... it's only about waist high. there is no fence to prevent people from intentionally
jumping. roger brubaker is the suicide prevention coordinator for lane county public health. he
35

says even if there were fencing... it might not prevent somebody from picking a different spot.
"how we see ourselves as community members positioned to be responsible for the care of
ourselves and others is probably one of the strongest driving influences behind the suicide rate.
and the more our community accepts a sense of shared responsibility around suicide
prevention, that's when we will starts seeing our numbers go down." according to lane county...
our suicide rate is 50 percent higher than the national average. but brubaker said falling is one
of the least likely ways people die by suicide. chynna... I reached out to the city to see what if
anything they're doing to prevent this sort of tragedy in the future. a Police spokeswoman told
me that two deaths didn't make it quote "a suicide hotbed." now... if you or a loved one is
suffering from thoughts of suicide please call the national suicide prevention lifeline at 1-800273-talk.

harvey: welcome to tmz live. harvey levin here. charles: charles here. harvey: so we have a twist
in the r. kelly case. r. kelly is behind bars after the feds arrested him thursday night. there are
two women who have been partly the subject of the surviving r. kelly documentary. their
parents have felt they have been brainwashed. there were reports, these women, joycelyn
savage and azriel clary -- charles: had been evicted from r. kelly's apartment in chicago. harvey:
not only not so, but we got video of them in the digs. charles: they say nothing has changed for
them since his arrest. >> i'm going to show you a view so you guys can know it is real. they
know where i'm at. we've been here for years. we move freely. we come and go freely. we just
went out this morning. do not believe everything you hear. other than that, we want to say
thank you to all of robert's fans. we see the support you are showing him all over social media.
charles: they are putting on the best face possible, I think is how their parents would feel.
harvey: the parents think they are brainwashed. charles: we've seen videos of them where they
say they are not being held against their will, but their parents and a lot of other people don't
believe that, but they certainly make it seem like nothing has changed. harvey: can I just say
that joycelyn barely said anything in the video -- joycelyn's parents believe these two women
have a suicide pact, that if r. kelly goes down, they have created this pact. charles: we are told -harvey: azriel's parents don't believe that. >> once we broke the story, people were trying to
figure out where the girls were, we heard about the suicide pact. azriel's parents say there is no
suicide pact, they are fine, and then this video surfaced. azriel's parents told me, we know
where she's at, she's fine, and there is no suicide pact. charles: we know that part of the reason
joycelyn's parents were concerned is they went to chicago pd for a welfare check before r.
kelly's arrest. when the police went there, nobody was home. they had no reason to believe
that joycelyn was there. we are told that joycelyn and az riel were not home when the welfare
check happened. they say they are free to leave whenever they want. harvey: I want to make
one point that I don't think has been made loudly enough. joycelyn's parents have suggested
that these kids have been brainwashed and that they are really not doing this of their own free
will, that they've been brainwashed by r. kelly, who they say has abused so many women, and
here's the thing about that. even if they have been brainwashed, they are in their mid-20's.
charles: we should say, because when you see that video, joycelyn on the left is 23 and azriel is
36

21. they are adults. harvey: and there is nothing that their parents can legally do to pull them
out, even if they have been brainwashed. the law is that if somebody is being held against their
will, but when you are brainwashed, it just means you are on board with somebody because
they pressured you, and when you are an adult, there's really nothing they can do. >> imagine a
different scenario where law enforcement could step in when parents think their kids are
brainwashed. there would never be apparent who wouldn't seek this kind of relief. parents
think their kids make bad decisions all the time. you have to live with these bad, potentially
awful decisions, and hopefully they learn from those and move on. harvey: my question with
the apartment is, who is paying the rent? r. kelly was behind on child support, couldn't pay his
bail. it ain't cheap to live in trump tower chicago. >> unless he paid in advance. >> because
these charges are insane. harvey: I get it. the only problem I have is -- >> where is the money
coming from? harvey: he has been so behind in child support. charles: do we know if he's
paying rent or does he own it? is it a condo? harvey: he might own it. but I don't know. >> I am
julie in the atl and I definitely agree with lauren to a certain extent. I believe these women have
been brainwashed. even though they are grown women, they are young and impressionable.
they've been going along with this for so long, I wouldn't be surprised if they are on some type
of payroll. wouldn't be a large one. harvey: we are going to move on to something that I find so
upsetting. charles: one thing on r. kelly. he is in court on tuesday. it will be interesting to see
whether or not both women show up in court.

there's a new push to bring in more mental health resources for wildland firefighters. we're
learning there has been an increase in firefighter suicides. however, the national interagency
fire center says it's hard to track specific numbers. they can't tally suicides outside of work
hours. and some families don't want the cause of death released. but, experts say the highintensity camaraderie of the wildfire season can be followed by months of isolation in the
offseason and sometimes money concerns without a steady paycheck. and please remember -there is help available 24-seven. if you or someone you know needs someone to talk to, you can

responsiveness that we have identified as being really critical and looking at this as more of a
health issue rather than just a law enforcement issue is really critical he says having a county
government that sets aside funding for suicide prevention is rare and that sets our community
apart from others in state... and the nation. I reached out to the city of eugene for comment
about this and a spokesperson with police tells me two suicides does not make this garage a
target for that sort of thing now later tonight I will have links to resources you can find here in

both people were thankfully brought to safety by police but they did cause a lot of traffic

objects onto the pavement. >> there is a human being, a loved one up there. that's why we

now we want to shift gears to talk about a troubling, new report from the federal government
that shows more middle school and high school students are being bullied on- line. the research
arm of the education department put out these numbers and found 25% of students between
12 and 18 say they were bullied during the 2016-2017 school year and 27% believed the
bullying would happen again and 15% say they were bullied on-line or by text. girls were more
likely to be bullied with insults or name calming for instance being the target of rumors or
insulted or called names. they didn't say why on-line bullying is increasing and students weren't
asked about the web sites or social media network used for bullying, but the federal
government hopes it can help and they can report the schools and figure out how to fix this
problem. we want to highlight a national non-profit that provides free 24- 7 texting to people in
crisis. the crisis text line is designed to help those in a moment of crisis. supervisor cassidy
walker is here. since you launched in 2013, some of the numbers are staggering. we'll talk
about the idea of texting which is here to stay. we rely on it in this show. in real life and
important times like this and in crisis, there's kind of new thinking that it's actually easier. why
do you think it is more likely for someone to pick up and text you they need they than call you?
the number one thing I can think of is because of privacy. someone can be in the room texting
us about their crisis. you don't need to speak out loud. it makes it more accessible for people
deaf or hard of hearing and just provides that accessibility. >> this is also personal. the texter is
connected with a crisis counselor. this is a real human trained. they are all volunteers by the
way which is special. they are volunteering their time in a time of crisis. these are pros and real
people responding to them. this is not some automated thing. >> that's right. anyone over 18
can be a crisis counselor. we provide you the training and empathy has no age, race or gender.
anyone who wants to help can volunteer and be a crisis counselor to help those who reach out.
>> I was looking at the web site and you have some interesting data there that is certainly
apparent. it's important for me to read this stuff and give you context of what's going on. I
notice relationships and depression or sadness were the top two trends. >> reporter: that's
right. >> is that what you're seeing? >> reporter: yes, >> yes and when they say relationships, it
can be anything. it can be parents, friends, significant other and really encompasses anyone you
are in contact with you consider a relationship and depression and sadness, we see that cooccurring with relationships and other issues such as suicide or bullying or whatever it may be.
41

>> we are talking about teenagers specifically here. I saw that more than half of college
students, more than half, say that their own mental health is poor or below average. that's
concerning to hear and what many people look back on now say that was the most fun time of
my life. at the time right now, a lot of people are struggling. you hear from a lot of college
students? >> yeah, it's amazing -- it's tragic, but it's just surprise to go see how many college
students are thinking of ending their own life so they don't have to take a final. stress is
enormous and weare putting pressure on them and they think they are a burden to reach out.
crisis text line meets the need by being 24/7, being free and being completely confidential so
you can talk about anything you need in that moment that you are having that hot crisis. >> I
think I read there were senators involved trying to get a movement to put the text line on the
back of maybe student body cards, that kind of a thing. what work are you doing with schools
to try to make this more universal, so people don't have to search for this information, and they
know where they've got it? >> nationally, I know in california our number is in the back of all
school ids whether that's college or elementary school, anywhere, but locally we have a
partnership with the Washington state department of health as well as ospi so that school
districts if we have our key word partnership heal so you text that number in Washington state
for support. >> we've taken your number and if you text the word home to 206-448-4545,
they've already got that number plugged in. they text home. we'll kick them back a link to the
great work you are doing there. the crisis text line, cassidy, thank you for being here. >>
absolutely. >> keep up the great work. >> thank you for having me.

a similar story I rarely marshall enhance same thing this isn't you know margin you train with
her she's a she's a university Washington college is the next her yet I moved out to sea island
thanks 99 to work with her as an undergraduate and ended up staying for graduate school and
and even after she time this weekend class on suicide so bunch of clinical psychology she's we
all get in a room whose starting Friday night you have a glass of wine she would ask us about
suicide you what we saw at whether it was a decision that so she'll make on their own or not
and then we talk also said for two days that was a deft weekend there's nothing like it but at
one point a role model a patient for her and after she asked me is this is something you're
experiencing as well and it was at that time but them that's striking the sheshan same question
may I ask you what it was like for you to be asked that directly I think the first time your asset to
him it's normal for defenses to come up for them to have this automatic kind of like oh no not
me or is my faith is my staff showing like is it obvious that I’m struggling or something and me
that's a bad thing who I think is just normal for to feel uncomfortable and that's okay an inch of
ice water just threw that out there because it's kind of a compelling idea but you study yourself
now are involved in this website now matters now that take and you become have devoted
yourself to suicide and suffering and week suicide prevention so what have you learned how
the core of the drive behind that question I think that marshall man asked both of us was that
any insight she had had is that it's not something we'd directly asked I said before I lost my
brother my brother killed himself and I spoke to him a day or so before he died I didn't ask are
you considering killing yourself I just got together with them because I knew his girlfriend said
he was having a hard time you know I kind of knew what that meant in the back of my mind
you know but I just said how you doin' riot on doing okay I thought he'd get counseling them to
get some counsel but didn't asked directly about suicide that was one ever insights is that that's
hard to ask it's important to ask it I think that's true one of the things I realized in the past 10
years compared to the 10 years before that was the experience of people who are really
suffering and who are suicidal when they were close in my life to me I crew I just developed
much closer understanding better understanding of what that experience was like an interview
people more in depth about what happened before an attempt my perspective changed even
though I had 10 years of training with marshawn hand and working with suicidal people so
there's things that came out of that that were surprising to me and one of those is that people
sometimes make a decision to kill himself in a very short period of time I want to believe that I
44

wanted to believe that it look we put a lot of thought into a decision like that and that if there's
so much thought and there's a lot of room for prevention thinking scary to think about the idea
that maybe people make that decision a short period time yes usually alone and very
impulsively so getting ice water you kind of I heard you interviewed about some little things
that can just in that moment in a very short time we might have to save somebody things that
might help and the interviewer compared to stop drop and roll like know if you were on fire we
kind of all no stop drop and roll so what have you found out that they can help exactly I think
you can throw your hands and say well people make a decision she for a period of time then we
just can't do anything but if that were true we wouldn't be able to prevent people from dying
when they were on fire physically right that is such an overwhelming experience that none of us
would know what to do if we didn't know what to do with them and we only know what to do
is because we talk about it ahead of time we practice ahead of time we learned about it in
Canada and I really think in kindergarten alongside physical fire there should be done to stop
drop and roll promotional fires and one of the fastest ways we know would reduce the intensity
of emotions that that tend to drive suicidal behavior or also a problem behaviors one of the
fastest ways to reduce emotions aroused a defector Vegas your bagel nerve and cold water is
one way to do that cold water nor ticker called charm yes so too do the research showing that
some emerging face and very cold water so and emerging temple in your forehead and under
your eyes that that can affect that nerve and reduce your emotional arousal your heart rate will
actually reduce fairly rapidly we suggest people that for 30 seconds at a time 30 seconds in the
second out for around 5 minutes 3 to 5 minutes another on your on your service stop drop and
roll list is to make eye contact with someone that if you are in that in that terrible state connect
somebody look at someone we talk about them that having experienced myself really intense
periods of suffering and having times suicidal thoughts what I know is that your focus is so
narrow and it's really hard to bring or draw your attention to anything else you're we do know
is that a human and I contacted one of the most powerful stimuli or just in this case a
distraction and that that is that that is possible and so this is strategically using eye contact to
help someone get out of their brain like to get a break for a moment from their brain and in the
process also there in the presence of someone else when he was less likely to kill yourself riots
and but that could even be go look at your view your landlord going to lobby your go-to they go
to the 7 11 men look at the person in the ire across the counter but right there I mean if you're
not if you're doing something other than telling yourself and not killing yourself and if you're
going to kill yourself you might as well do something uncomfortable first might as well try
something first minutes one of the things we ask people to do the third set this is to wait to
make a decision to tell yourself for 24 per firmly 48 hours soon to hold off for now is what we
know is that that state changes and a lot of people never get the chance to figure that out yeah
that could mean take a nap you go you're considering taking her own life or how about just you
know taken happened in and do it you know that tomorrow is another day or what is the deal
with some deal with life few hours we think it's made even more complicated than that your
physiology needs to change and that ice water changes your physiology and sleep change
physiology Marshall I used to say that part of the reason she got people repeatedly overdose
was because it made them sleep which change physiology was changed their mood and made
no longer worse said something about just physically about sweeping and people described this
suicidal state overwhelming force kill himself as a physiological intensity you know this is dr so
45

Whiteside university Washington clinical psychologist and I want to ask you about this tv show
on netflix has been in the news it's called 13 reasons why a lot of attention about how it treated
the issue of teens suicide and this week the show we decided to go back and edit out a scene
that showed visually show the act of suicide what did you think of that decision and what we
know abo t suicide is that when were exposed to them we're exposed to ideas are exposed to
exempt list essentially examples of people taking their own life in response to bad things that's
we learned that the normal response that our brains might believe is normal spots but on when
we see alternative choices are people who take alternate path we see different model of how
to deal with things and things go better that seem physical with images of how people from
themselves can be harmful and so absolutely are glad they removed that content okay so not
all suicide awareness which frazier not a suicide awareness is helpful not necessarily right so I
think one of the things in our field that has happened for a long time we do a lot of education
about the fax and a lot of those facts are fairly hopeless we do less of his showing people how
to get through so said crises and that's one of the reasons that marshall help help me not
developing now matters now website yes this this website rule but a key to marshal and hands
work and into yours in this website there's two this therapy called dialectical behavior therapy
and it it basically seems to come down to right to touch of tolerating observing your emotions I
guess being aware of your emotions not being carried away and tolerating to stros yeah so it's
helping change your relationship your emotional like by chris increasing awareness of them and
then them your judgment of them as well as what you do with them and how you cope with
them we using specific strategy is prompted cup tbt skills which are part of this really big
treatment dvt skills are some of the pieces of dialogue to be shown on this now matters now
website you have videos of people talking about their own experience part I assume because
getting into therapy is hard the time they are the logistics and expense especially depending
where you exactly that's the reason for the website working added blue large , hospital where
people who came into the hospital had very few resources to get treatment as that over and
over again people desperate for care and unable to get access to look to care that was before
Obama care but it's still very hard said the website with funding from the national institute of
mental health was developed to help bridge that gap okay maybe my last question is suicide
prevention that's a phrase we're hearing a lot of course I wish my brother still here right we
wanted to we don't want people to kill themselves but is suicide prevention the same as living a
better life and living a life we want to live same thing yeah I think sometimes the field of suicide
prevention the title that we have it puts emphasis on the wrong so baller the impostor on the
on for laval gets into your point right it's it is about building a life worth living that's what we
want and need to put our attention on and I think we're like the no way back here trying to
prevent you from killing themselves some as we get lost in the weeds of that and not helping
people bullet understand why they wanted guy and what would make them not want to die as
marcia would say yep okay anything and leave us with I think about it you know if you are
somebody who experiences intense emotions that's just a beautiful thing and it's something to
be harnessed if you're still learning how to do that marchionne enhanced the key skills book is a
great resource to do that yeah he can you can be aware of your emotions and not be cannot be
wow rush to them not be you know carried away can have be the captain of the boat and
exactly yeah and use that you know they hear less even better than would otherwise be and I
think the super strength yeah super power yet few this you or somebody you know might be

22 random acts of kindness. for 22 days. in 22 states.. that's what two women are setting off to
do in a few weeks. all to raise awareness of suicide prevention and mental health. camila rios
met with one of the women in this cross country tour .. hey camila? scott.. the inspiration
behind this cross-country tour for both of these women comes from losing their sons to suicide.
the goal now is to spread kindness and compassion all across america letting people know they
aren't alone. chris lowe founded the non-profit fall forward across america in honor of her son
hudson who would have turned 22 last week. she'll be getting in an rv next week and starting
the cross country tour in her hometown of orlando, florida. all it takes is one random act of
kindness to change someone's life.. along the way, annie ackerman brown a local mom who lost
her son this past december will be joining the tour and helping with the mission of the trip it's
not just the loss of our child it's any family that has lost a loved one especially their motto? fall
forward meaning never give up.. we all have a piece of the puzzle and we really need to bring
the pieces together. the goal of this trip is simple: spread kindness across know that they
matter America, letting people and someone out there cares. just one little thing can change
someone's day it doesn't have to be life changing but it can certainly change someone's day.
the hope is that one act of kindness will lead to another and so on... in the end inspiring
everyone to be kind. we're in a society now that unfortunately we just don't see a lot of
humanity happening on a general level I think we need to get back to that. the tour ends right
here in Washington on august 15th.. as her final act of kindness for the tour ackerman brown is

depression has become increasingly common among American teenagers especially teen girl
who are now 3 times as likely as teen boys to have had recent experiences with depression this
is him from the 2017 national survey on drug use and health in 2017 13% of u.s. teenagers at
ages 12 to 17 3.2 million teens said they expect had experienced at least one major depressive
episode the past year that was up all the way from 8% another woods went from two million
teenagers to 3.2 million one in 5 teenage girls had experienced at least one major depressive
episode over the past year in 2017 by comparison only 7% of teenage boys now here's the the
very big question why would it be so disproportionate in other words according to every
measure hell it educational achievement girls have are experiencing today let fewer problems
in school the boys certainly violence criminality boys are much more subject so why isn't the
girls are more depressed data and socio this article but I think fit the g.m. two dancers obvious
social media social media can be intensely depressing and and again it's been associated with
suicide epidemic to the depression is a serious girls are more likely to get treatment for
depression when they're teenagers then boys are much more likely which means that almost all
the treatment for depression is of girls 3 times as likely to experience as depression and they're
also more likely to experience depression to get professional help for and and by the way I do
think that some of this great increase in depression comes through greater awareness and from
greater likelihood to actually diagnose people properly it is a proper proper and real problem
and yes it is something that our medical care system should be able to help with about 3 in 10
teens 29% said they felt tenser nervous about their day almost every day 45% sound says said
they felt tenser nervous sometimes that's part of being a teenager about a third of teen girls
reported feeling this way every day okay this is a problem matic and teenage girls are much
more likely almost double as likely to engage in over use of social media in fact there's some
estimates that over half of teenage girls have that challenge.

first of all I ask you about the situation with tracy I have not heard anything about a funeral or
of or anything and it's been very quiet but not much being said you know why it's all been quiet
and when it's consignment I need I can only speculate I don't have that information neither
moon but i'm pretty sure it's very overwhelming and a lot of things have to get taken care of
when that's a curse so i'm respectfully keep my distance and sending as much love and support
as I can m & m's and I don't have any information when that I was notified but buy caller and
for suppose a prank and I hung up I said no this can't be true and I called the police in the area
where she lived and I asked and they said nothing and then I call this special they said nothing
51

and I want to get that number backs he got on the phone in and talk with this person and
dispatch call from the police bureau in the county she lived in said yes she died she passed
away and dumb I knew from called her husband they found his number and I knew that he told
me that she had died because of hanging and that time I couldn't believe this and many people
couldn't believe this and so they were all saying quite you know she was murdered I said wise
because of what she was doing she was if she was investigating a lot of things could have
gotten into trouble and I said why didn't happen that apparently is everybody else is coming
forward talking about this usually involves investing such she said some stuff about videos she
was aware of on the internet will get into that later but so I guess the question is are the police
satisfied with the the suicide investigation are they doing something more a I did I can't speak
on their behalf but I can't say that I spoke to the head investigator and it is still and open and
ongoing investigation and I was sure that all information that is gathered is going to be looked
at respectfully and I was able to kind of fill him in the eye and how popular she was how wellknown and and that there is video that is circulating that has specific things from heard and and
that was released after her death he was unaware that elliott's and he's more aware of what
it's going on in the world the internet and the conversations being had him I believe that them
yeah it's very good that's happening because they know that we were released I was being told
that maybe we should call cybercrimes unit and and talk with them because they are well
aware of the harassment she claimed she was having before which she showed me she was
having the arrest of she didn't name names to me a she name names are videos though which
is kind of interesting it's who knows if they are involved they're not involve us we're
investigation have intel act but did you know and and even in our discussion tonight i'm sure
that we give details maybe you don't know about we're not going to give specious details or
speculative details are our part I probably because it's not going to do anybody any good insight
into the investigation any good if we do this because a lot of people don't care because they're
not as close as we are we're very close to it and as I said before we're very close yet so far away
because so many I guess you could call them dance so many you know what we know is it tracy
was she compartment lies a lot of things in life and everybody had a role but I have a purpose
everybody knew her but she is so many other people she touched so many people in her life
days nobody feels the loss they feel that they feel terrible loss and in some cases they feel
terrible fear the somebody is strong has will character is tracy twine and could be investigating
something and because often the prime of her life this is a message this is a huge message to a
lot of people that you know there is an active underground and active underground doesn't
want to be exposed because we've heard of others like tracy who attempted to expose
meanwhile up in the same way when the whistle you know hangings deaths are suicides were
you know it was just speeches mostly not even he does something that unit it doesn't measure
up but not his numbers up you can fit there is good in this world and there's evil and she was
brave enough to step forward and enlighten us solve a pond the darker places and I really feel
it's up to us to do really good in this world in her name I agree with your case.

okay first off before I came on this show I focused on tracy disaffected pull her energy and keep
in mind she just recently crossed over her energy is right there so she's not really gone but she
is gone because physically she doesn't exist the way we see it but she was ready to speak
heartbroken about her own passing okay this is something that took her by surprise me try to
get this out really quick I wrote notes so I wouldn't forget what he said he became really strong
said she was heartbroken about her passing was not a suicide she was actually tricked there
was some sort of and knees were kidnapping but somebody moves terror and you something
the physical body that structure like a neat call like a muscle relaxant she couldn't move her
arms she couldn't move my legs she could kind of hear but she could not free herself and she
was held in somewhere and there's no way when they actually I i don't know if I should say this
but this is what I got from her there's no way that they actually think that she killed herself the
way they foundered because she couldn't have done that herself there was that discussed on
your computer you state governor phone the phone was completely erased before she passed
because she contacted the person who actually committed the crime against her what she did
acknowledge after she calmed down a bit and by that I mean her energy was very hyper and
very overwhelming like she wanted to get it through she couldn't quite tell me everything
around the situation but told me that somebody was her friend that turns this was somebody
she knew that did this okay and somebody was closing his husband and wife is what I was
getting I don't know that it's taken I could actually get that guy she didn't say names there was
one name I could tell run one name which are not going to say on air but I did message him
earlier today but she was actually shocked so this was some sort of surprise in the person that
and again these were kidnapped with her she was removed from where she was and it was well
she was on her way back somewhere she was kind of you advice somebody she felt was a
friend of hers and so this is a beach trail on the total level what she did tell me is there were
many people on the astro level right beside us okay she's literally right side she is not cross over
this is not a bad thing she's not going to cross over she was saying at least in my head that she's
going to continue to do the work that she has to do she was very disappointed about not
initiate what she started and she said there's no way that she even understood everything that
happens there's many other components that she didn't even touch sean I don't even know
53

what that means i'm assuming she means the spiritual around worried that you know the in the
colts and digital realm we don't know about but she spoke of this and he's made me feel she
was putting impressions my mind pretty quickly sees very vocal about it and she continues to
work they fried keep per gallon but they can't touch sure is what she's saying on the other side
where she is she can't these stocks she was speaking I don't know if you know this because I did
not know her purse light but she's speaking of people that are on some level remote viewing
where she is right now to try to stop her from continuing to do her work which is very strange
but this is kind of her mind set in this she was trying to stay focused on that the other thing is
she wanted to come back here right now like right now so I was trying to say in my head don't
do that because sometimes they think souls make a decision to come right back when they
banned thrown into a very tragic and dramatic situation they want to come right back so I was
trying to mend the toddler not to do that she might change her mind we wouldn't know heard
she have to be go through this whole process again being born and being different person
which she really wanted to come right back and she was actually really distraught about what
happened but couldn't explain because they came from behind I think cappie I wasn't happy did
well was not a suicide by the way that was that was not why not suicide and they seem to be
looking at kids death and her death together as if it's the same person that's what I was able to
get work connected so she may be rented to somebody well researching him and it's almost as
if she was trying to make me think she worked around somebody but he did they were helping
with the workers she knew the men worked around a neighbor part of part of how she got
tricked he did they trailed tight saying wow that's what I try to get it out quick sorry for that's
okay yeah would you appreciate it a lot of things to comprehend and we take a break right now
mr sloan bellen and what she was what she has picked up from the spur world with tracy it's
very interesting things she talked about that and we're kind of looking at each other going wow
there's some amazing things they're the best certainly we will looking to win and explore
further 8.7 7.3 1.1 one that's a 7.7 3.1 0 one we will be yet coming back the phone calls it any
other questions may have your ground zero we'll be right back.

like to stay really pisses me off what happened to her and it's unacceptable it's beyond
unacceptable dad which I know you guys don't accept it and it's terribly sad for you working
with her like the people in our society have to start getting a clue they really have to get a clue
not this many people are killing themselves it's just ridiculous he doesn't happen that often very
few people actually going out and doing that at these ages I mean if you have an issue mental
illness that's one thing but that's not what we're talking about and she got it she was actually
silence for trying to protect children not only that not only that I read you know I had read a
few books is I was studying at and one-time mortuary science talked about suicide and onetime suicides apparently women don't hang themselves a that's one thing they don't do
because what that does is it displays them in such a way where they don't like to be would
meet with the guy you want the one seen in that way here's what a person is hang its message
they're sending a message and that's why they're hanged it usually with unused pills or so is the
razor blades about cover something just something that would be clean dop us they would
54

make a big scene and that's another thing that struck me as odd as because I remember
thinking at first I heard the guy who called for thought she had stabbed herself for something
like that I go wow and be very violent way to go but then when I talk with you back right now
big one and then when I heard the it she was found hanged my gone but that doesn't make any
sense either and notice says she was commit suicide it would be a letter saying this is what I
want my son to have this is what I want to have with my work this is what I want I have a few
she believed she was contributing something to the world she didn't seem that she hung
herself like i'm 7 feet tall she did not hang herself and only 5 6 so i'm not but she did not hang
herself and I actually told me the way that she was hong okay which you're touching on but I
am because i'm not privy to that actual like direct information but maybe you are the way that
her body was found pong she is showing me that it would have been impossible for it occurred
to actually do that to herself and she hung herself that's the first thing she said I like it I couldn't
do it this way she could hang herself obviously anybody could but not the way she was found so
there's something in the way it however she was found yeah there's a lot of speculation as to
what happened between the countries on the time she was taken down and that's another
time when we have more investigation don't compromise that bella thank you for being on the

About an investigation in to how she died we we know what the initial word of the stream his
suicide that's something that was hard to fathom especially the fact she had a family she had a
son jett husband she had a lot of work for a body of work that was said remarkable she had
great friends case don't want our friends here tonight and we really appreciate you know the
you being here because I know it's tough it's been tough for all of us so we met a couple days
ago and we were talking about you just what we would do do you know we didn't want to we
want for any investigations maybe going on maybe then we got word from some other friends
they were not closing the case the investigation is ongoing and not much more than that we
have my correct pre-match I mean where were all on the same page now and I just I think you
you and to ground zero and all they didn't you were able to do with terror and how you both
contributed so much to this is a continuing narrative the work they did was important and it but
it stands it stands for something so did she sort of her work and it will end and it will continue
to go on this its ships thousands of fans thousands of fans all over the world and and word
we're going to continue what which she left top a visionary sp aldrin and jeb with us tonight I
know you know kate brings up a great point that you know all of us you know we have a
responsibility especially now I mean it since her death there's been so many things happened
the it seemed to fulfill our least vindicated a lot of work untie even though sloan said you know
what we're talking about some paid like a steam we're talking about those core the vampires
with the vipers in the dark parts of society in and willing to rob virtue in and take and make life
so fragile fragile for children and for those who are vulnerable I was just curious as brg don't
want to comment on this what do you think the next move should be well I think the era of
things to keep an eye on there and and and be willing and kid to follow up with that you know
you know people law enforcement to make sure beat fellow be kind I made the e-mailer you
55

know tamron about that I know that there are thousands of that here and them were not
satisfied with the answer suicide especially concerning what is the quiet absolutely no kanter
instructional that further while being her son who you are the most important thing in life
whether son and so many other than that just do left left to the rally point and that give all of
her work in one place and get creative ways than an online space where we can all continue
this indefinitely and them you know we return the world we're going now to keep the curation
of our passion and do what we can build that back to the also people really know and future
mood tricky why she was share our information on the information she started to spread
information we've got about this stuff also be really careful because I don't want anybody else
pulling strings and to lawn and ending up in a dark place where this would happen to you know
I don't anybody else being in dangerous place right so please communicate be very careful and
or you're looking at him and and sharing everybody I think it I think what's interesting and one
of the things one of the reasons why I wanted to show tonight is well to be honest you know I
have not heard of any arrangements for a funeral that all from family or anyone else so that's
one of the things that has been completely perplexed because usually have someone passes
away you know there's a few coming you know there's a service coming a reason why i'm so
kind of perplexed about it because I was the one that officiated over her husband her first
husband's services when he passed away I was a hard I was there he gave the eulogy for brian
her first husband I give the eulogy and and one of the things about brian is he committed
suicide I rember tracy telling me I would never put myself in that position because she saw
what it was like when she came upon brian upon his death upon his suicide she is I would never
put myself in that position she told me that and and cheat she expressed that to me she
wanted me to be the one to give the eulogy I did and it was it was said it was so touching to me
and night and I thought to myself but this is word dance you know brian he's passed away we
have his ashes were meeting in part we're doing eulogy that's how it's going to be that's what's
and tracy got on with her life she remarried again of course site fishing without marriage and
then from there now we are in a position again we're so close to someone and thinking I just
feel like I have to be the one to give the eulogy give the service while not being called upon to
give the eulogy the service and i'm thinking but the memoriam should not die or and with the
service is some park words some graveyard it needs to get done right now it needs to be done
we're everybody around the world hears it and they feel the secity not to leave a trace see it
some graves somewhere or have her ashes spread somewhere we should never be seen again
her her spirit her soul her work to put all that in your work and that is how we have a memorial
for 4 for tracy why it is we move all of her work into public life and we all we all read we offer is
made we go we help and we we keep the spirit alive that's the only way you we just can't give
her a memorial or two not even a memorial I know of that was in part over no one else we have

would show up in as bases could be beige pants white shirts and just walk up and say Hey his
first line of them was Hey I really care about you and never in before you make this decision
should ask you we have some fresh baked cookies and he's get this strange looks from people
because it would be like dude I'm sitting on the edge of the bridge he would tell him listen
before make this decision have won our first cookie is no cookie right but is also this it was this
it was this connection back to childhood his connection that now in his e-mail hacked all that
we just turned around and he was a 100% when people would take the cookie 100% of the time
David get off the bridge if they didn't take the cookie he was about 90% in that confrontation

afternoon... he says a man ran into his shop around 3 pm yesterday... saying a man under the
overpass was trying to kill himself. he said he had his hand behind his back and when he came
up to the window, he said you're the last guy that is going to see me alive. shortly after that ...

workload, and if you miss one day it messes you up for the week." but for others.... like morgan
wilson, sometimes he can't help letting stress get to him. "i get stressed out easy... and i'd like
to take a day off of school to get my mind off things" whether it's depression, anxiety, feeling
overwhlemed or spiraling out of control...the mental health bill is intended to teach students
how to take a step back. with sucide rates on the rise and Oregon being 40% above the national
average...experts are saying this is the perfect time to implement something like this. evita:
"according to the Oregon health authority, suicide is the second leading cause of death among
people ages 10-24....which is why an expert from south lane mental health center hopes to
reduce these numbers." "this has been an issue that has been up front and center and how
children are being taken care of and how their taking care of one another. so I think something
like this can have a big impact. the ability to give people permission to take care of themselves
is a real gift." sands also tells me that he knows that the new bill will get abused by students
who just want to get out of school...but he also says that there will be students who will really
use mental health days to take care of themselves. at this point, it is still unclear when the the
bill will go into effect....but sands also says students should continue to find ways to take care
of their mental health. "you just have to look at the bigger picture. if I get this done, i'll be good
to go...just power through it" reporting in eugene, evita garza kezi 9 news.

with the rental boat in tow, and then set fire to the cabin cruiser. then he used the rental boat
to get back to shore. - [narrator] in March, 1990, earl morris is indicted for his wife's murder,

gun. - on June 3rd, 1989, earl and ruby had a fight about his coming visit to donna kay in los

see peggy. (gunshot) - [narrator] earl claims he heard a shot from the house. back in the
bedroom, he found ruby covered in blood. she'd shot herself. - earl said ruby committed
suicide. that was his defense. - earl said ruby was depressed over all of the family secrets she'd
kept buried for so many years. that her son, randy, is the product of incest when she was raped
by her own father, and that she's had an affair and had to keep the real father of cindy secret. earl said that she was so tormented by it all that she killed herself. when he discovered ruby's
body, he also said he knew the shame it would bring on the whole family. he also thought he
might be blamed for it. so he decided to get rid of the evidence. - [narrator] he testifies that he
cleaned up ruby's body in the bathroom. - he put the body in his car. it had no trunk, so he had
to prop ruby's corpse up in the passenger seat. then he drove 400 miles to san diego. in san
diego, he loaded the body into the family cabin cruiser and motored 12 or 13 miles off the coast

bullet hole in her left temple. - ruby was right-handed and it's almost impossible themselves in
the left temple for someone to shoot when they're holding the gun in their right hand. so that
was the first problem with earl's testimony. came from the forensic techs. - even more damning
evidence they testified that the luminol test on the headboard showed two layers of blood
spatter coming from two slightly different directions. which meant there were two shots. - and
no one who commits suicide twice in the head. shoots themselves it just doesn't happen. [narrator] it's obvious to the jury that earl pulled the trigger. they deliver the verdict. in less
than three hours, guilty of first degree murder. is sentenced to life 51-year-old earl morris in

thanks so much for joining us would have won forced to well we although it's sick days are and
you know whether you're in school you and your work with it look nicer better over that they
are right so normally if you're a student in school you get sick days I think you know not like you
do when you're at work the same kind of idea but you know you can take off your sake but that
does not include mental Help with so in Oregon where they have 80 40% higher than the
national average suicide rate a bunch of teenagers actually helped an act of building has
become a lot now that allows students to take mental health is and the whole idea is that there
are a lot of people who don't come to school here and there because there having mental
health issues but then lying about it and just saying that it's something else not coming and so
the idea is not only to give relief to people who do need to take a day off for something that is
different than physical ailment like having a cold or the flu but the idea is to defeat able to talk
about it because that's the problem like a lot of teenagers and people worried to be Frank
people older than us just don't like to talk about it there's a huge stigma still connected to
mental health and the ideas that if people actually have to come out and say this is how I'm
feeling this is why not coming to school then it will be stigmatized and hopefully they can get
help and these things won't escalate and turn into suicide taking nip it in the I love this because
as we know that in school my 3 remember the peer pressure and things we all witnessed or
gone through in-school it wasn't pretty we like to call their only 16 years old but for 16 year-old
some things we went through we're pretty traumatic where there was a breakup would in
school or a loss of friendship in school or whether it was not doing well on tests in school there
the mental stability some kids is a very fragile at that time so I love the idea of a mental health
day Yeah I did to him I think it's really important and I'm glad you mention hearing about talking
about mental health and getting the idea across that there's no it there's nothing wrong about
taking the day off because you need to recalibrate or you feel overwhelmed word you know
whatever's going on there's we all every single person has called out sick when they are not
actually sick because they just needed day to chill out and that should be normal and okay 12 in
Western society Western medicine there's this big disconnect between the brain and physical
body we treat them as their separate ways it does make sense because your brain is part of
your body in a note inside of the skin and there but it's totally treated differently and they do
affect each other and anybody who had stress anxiety knows that you know ends up affecting
your physical health and so I don't know why there's a disconnect you know aid that it's like you
can take a day off if you're physically said but not if you are mentally that and be like there's a
huge thing also where people take a pill for anything but a lot of people are really with this and
anti-depressants that's something that a lot of people have here Hey you take an aspirin you
know yet ahead why would you take this tell when you feel really depressed than I'm not saying
that it should be abandoned for depression but it really does help a lot of people but there's
still that's take math and emily you're like even R-rated I mean I had you know a really bad
breakup or really traumatic things happen with my family where I just was like I can go work
Rob because I can't think about anything else I can focus then I don't know why that doesn't
you know mean anything like why is that an excuse and I've learned over the years like when I
was younger I always saw ahead justify and what I would call it like you would call the phone I
81

really had to say exactly what was wrong with me and it's probably the culture of the workplace
for work but also American society like pull yourself up by your bootstraps going to work even if
you're sick and now days because something somebody told me I just say I'm sick I don't see
why and said Brett easier to do you know now but I was told it's none of their business why
your sector like people have physical ailments better bear thing to bring up what you should
have to say why do you have a sick day the you should be able whether it is a physical or mental
because of all the same then Yes it's the same Yes It is in our duties last week last week was
probably one of my weak and I was blessed and fortunate to be able to because on Monday
edge was a flat out not going to come to work and what I did was I came in later in that helped
so much Yeah I hope that employers across United States allow some of their employees say
Hey boss you know what I'm coming in today but coming like two 3 hours later you know me
just to just to get that little bit tiny little bit helps so much go such a long way maybe they need
to take the entire day off maybe you don't get the kids off to school and get some alone time
and just saying two to 3 hours okay they now are coming we wonder why so much we in
Westchester Melissa soon as they like to talk about we have such a problem with were behind
the 8 ball with mental health and suicide rates are going up and we're like Oman the last time I
talked to that person they were so great what everybody puts on this facade like were great
even when we're not doing a good job of taking care of herself Yeah meant to and making sure
there's always going to be people who take advantage you know if you work summer that you
know take off on everyone if somebody is but a lot of workplaces make you feel like you're in
middle school like can I go to the bathroom can I take a day off you feel afraid of your bosses
sometimes people feel like really locked in I have to be there at this time I have to be there until
the time and it's like you're being treated like a soldier I've got to say I'm just saying in general
Yeah where as you know I think there would be a lot of trust between employees and
employers if you were given a certain kind of freedom to take care of yourself if you got your
work done and there are so many places like start us have that unlimited vacation that is
intended to kind of fill that role but like I think a lot of us act out or get really stressed out and
quit jobs because we're not treated like adults in that way and given the freedom to take care
of ourselves autonomy goes a long way Yeah and it's really nice to know the difference
between being its dock and forced into a situation versus choosing to be there Yeah like even
with my girlfriend if she wants to do something and she's like what we're doing this I'll be like I
don't really want to do that but Hey do you want to do this is a much different look you okay
Yeah it's just it's medal games but I like this I like that it's a law in org was specifically school
days was this in employers as well at school days it actually is the first bill of its kind in the
nation right so we'll see if others follow suit.

Emily underwent the surgery last month. she was born a boy and knew from a young age that
was not who she was. with the support of her parents she took hormone blockers and then
estrogen to help develop her female body. >> for me it feels like I am finally fully complete. >>
she is a pioneer because she is at the forefront of this new generation of adolescents who are
realizing what they are much earlier in life and are able to transition. >> she is also aware of the
high rate of attempted suicide of transgender teen's and that's part of the reason that the
doctor considers operations like hers to be life-saving surgery. >>> tacoma city leaders have
made changes to make things safer for transgender people. they would like to amend building
codes to include the new signage.

Students in Oregon can now take mental health days like six days. a new law passed in the state
legislature. this comes as suicide rates are climbing in Oregon, especially among kids. according
to the centers for disease control, in Oregon, suicide is the number two cause of death of
85

people ages 10 to 34. both Oregon and Washington have a suicide rate well above the national
average. >> I think our children and schools need to be able to know that whether it is a
physical ailment or mental health ailment they are treated similarly, and they are not treated
differently just because it is a mental health issue. >>susan land, a behavioral health clinician in
the tri- cities says she thinks it is a good idea and something that will further the conversation
to keeping kids mentally healthy in school.

a change to state law will allow certain terminally ill patients in Oregon more direct access to
life ending medications under the state's assisted suicide law. Doctors making exceptions to the
waiting periods if the patient is likely to die before completing them. they're subject to over a
two-week waiting period designed to ensure patients are sure of their decision. opponents say
the move removes a critical safeguard.

i couldn't help but notice that steen had a mysterious suicide can't this morning and you know I
know everyone associated with the clintons that may have been a dirt on the clintons has some
kind of mysterious event happened to them and here is here for good and then you know this
guy is a choke and I suppose we tried to commit suicide in jail right well I won't touch anything
with regard to the room with to the clintons but I will I will say they have found the story very
disturbing about I have no brief for this man just free up steam but in the that this would
happen in the year 2019 in any american person either that he committed suicide or tried to
commit suicide early on to him I believe was done to him but the fact that even believe it was
done to him is group an indictment of the american prison system or people were beaten up
people were tortured by other prisoners this is it this is as bad as some of these people are this
is not this is not allowable this is too much bad stuff that goes on prisons including two with
solitary confinement people say you never bridge the right-left get gulf know you can't but
there are few issues in which right or left can agree and that is just yes he's lined up a society
can be judged in part by its treatment of prisoners and in that sense I have to say we we can be
proud the people but in all people just could be no rate in the amount of mail male rape in
prison that's 3 I took this coal I do not understand why if you were not guilty wire you put in it
in that orange prison guard when you go on trial what I don't understand that either member

we have new information on changes to Oregon's assisted suicide law... after governor brown
signed new legislation this week. the new legislation allows doctors to make exceptions to the
waiting periods if the patient is likely to die before completing them. previously under the
Oregon death with dignity act, patients had to wait more than two weeks... a period to confirm
patients were sure of their decision. opponents say the new legislation removes an important
safeguard. in this morning's fire watch... campfires are now banned at three Oregon
campgrounds. all three are in the gorge... ainsworth -- memaloose -- and viento state parks.
firefighters say it's a precautionary move. fire crews want campers to be able to turn off all
flame sources at a moment's notice. you can use a propane barbecue to cook, but not charcoal.
campfires are banned altogether. a park manager says high temps and strong winds have
increased the risk of a human caused fire. 3:00 we already had two small fires in the gorge this
year, so that went into the decision making as well. really, we don't ever want a campfire to
start a fire and that's part of why we're precautious. we don't want to be reactionary; we'd
rather take the forethought of being prepared and being cautious. 18 the ban will be in effect
until conditions get better. a 16-year-old teen from eugene is combining his love for baseball.
and his love for friends and family... to raise money for suicide prevention. "i've been playing
since I was born. when I picked up a baseball, I just fell in love with it." carson lydon is a junior
at church hill high school. in 2017 lydon lost a childhood friend to suicide. and to help
commemorate his friend, lydon created a non- profit organization called a world free of suicide.
87

the organization focuses on eliminating the stigma around suicide and fundraising for mental
health organizations in the eugene area. they hope to keep expanding...and teaming up with
the eugene emeralds is a start. "my dreams and goals are really endless. I want to make it into a
national non-profit, I want to be one of the biggest ones. I mean last year with our walk we
raised the most money in the country, but I want to make hundreds and thousands of dollars."
on august 11th his non-profit will be partnering with the ems to host a suicide prevention night.
all the proceeds from ticket sales will go to local mental health awareness groups. for more

correctional center with the latest. >>> sources tell CBS news Jeffrey Epstein may have tried to
kill himself in jail. he was found earlier this week on the floor of his cell crying and depressed.

suicide watch and now investigators are checking internal cameras. authorities will also
investigate whether another inmate may have attacked the 66-year-old or if Epstein have
created the incident to get a transfer to another jail. Epstein was arrested earlier this month on
conspiracy charges for abusing underage girls in 2002 through 2005. he pleaded not guilty but

I'm Dave Miller this is I think out loud starting in September K-12 students an organ will be able
to be excused from school for mental or behavioral health reasons the students pushed for the
change want to get rid of the stigma that led to a profound differences in how physical and
mental illnesses are handle proponents say this maybe the first state law of its kind anywhere
in the country I'm joined now by one student who made this happen haley Hardcastle just
graduate from sure high school she's going her first year at the University of Oregon in the fall
Robin Henderson is a doctor of psychology and chief executive of behavioral health at
Providence health great to have both of you on the show thank you think haley her Castle first
read you some of your fellow students come up with this idea I differ essentially mental health
days he had this idea started about a year ago at the Garden Association student Council
summer camp we got about 30 to 40 stinson room and we just started brainstorming what we
do about mental health problems if money or laws were any issue anything that you wanted
and they came up with passing the loss of their students could take days off if they need to and
why was that the topic to begin with and it all came together dozens of Oregon high school she
wanted affect some kind of change why was the mental health was at the top of your list of
things to do 12 months mean my peers this is something we talk about why even in casual
conversations because it's just such a common problem nowadays there's not a single one of
my peers that I know it hasn't been affected by mental health and pretty much every school
organ every community has been touched by someone trying to or successfully committing
suicide and I assume that's really scary thought so when they got together and that's how we
decide to talk about because we wanted to do something about it how in your experience and
people you talk to other people other districts other parts of state power mental health issues
handle right now by a school zone well a lot of schools have access to counselors and may even
afraid to a therapist outside her school but we have a long way to go and all appears that I've
90

talked to definitely agree with that I think we need a lot more funding and alomar resources
currently some schools teach them to halt to teach how to take care of yourself mentally and
health classes just like how they would with physical health them but not all schools do that
said be great to see that tim can you describe the way Using this new law starting in September
he will what how did she work in practice Yeah I would love to see the flaws teach young
people how to take care of themselves Let's say somebody has severe depression disorder you
know they're diagnosed by a doctor and it comes and goes and having a really tough week and
if they realized they needed day off maybe their parents and you know they're struggling with
depression but they're able to go to their parents and say I need a mental health day and
whether their panties Super supportive or not they have the law on their side now to help them
showed that this is something recognizable the state board and as a legitimate reason to slow
down and give yourself how my young people in the same situation have been dealing with that
in the past what would they do or say before work with the lucky ones to get good they can't
say they needed a mental health day and their parents could lie to the schools say they have
the flu or a headache and that as a reason why they're staying home and that is something we
saw happening a lot before but now we can see people being honest with their schools and
schools may be able to identify those States are struggling come Henderson has to but both Dr.
psychology a therapist and chief executive of behavior of the Providence health why did you
want to be a part of this effort we had started working in your organization still counsels a little
over a year ago when they called in response to campaign we were doing home be well and
they had a suicide at his school and they didn't know how to respond they needed resources
we do know this partnership with them around issues related to mental health and suicide and
started going to their conferences 0 summer camps a great idea we went there last year and
worked with more than 400 students over two weeks around if we talk about them on social
and we help with your schools and whatever we could do what would we do and basically
crowdsourced a yearlong campaign called be well so now we have students all over Oregon
who work to be well who are talking about mental health and school talking about helping us
develop curriculum teachers and students commute is doing grassroots campaigns and really
being part of this that's where we came because for us as the largest you really the largest beef
hope writer in Oregon we need to get further upstream and upstream youth is in the schools I
want to point out listeners at the National suicide Prevention lifeline it's a national network of
local crisis centers provide free and confidential emotional support to people and was a crisis or
emotional distress it's 24 hours a day 7 days a week their number is 102.3 8 to 5 5 of Henderson
can you give us a sense for the extent of mental health problems that they use seeing now
among school-age Oregonians how big an issue is this it's huge when you look at national
statistics that one in 5 people struggle with mental illness we know that that population of kids
especially between Mike 15 and 24 that's a mental illness really starts to foment and it starts to
be something that you first expect assist first rate bipolar really begins to be identified you add
that to the stressors better in school environment and the fact that this is where students are
6.8 hours a day and you're going to see higher than that 20% you're probably see more like 30
to 35% because it's such a concentrated population haley her Castle what are the stressors of
the school environment and I'm 2019 Yeah I have school there's a lot of stressors but the most
common ones are definitely things like and obviously tests homework but beyond that I think a
lot of adults don't realize is just the pressure to get somewhere and life and things like college
91

are probably the biggest test from me personally because you need to have extracurriculars
perfect grades in a perfect 8th and There's things like a 4.5 GPA exist Kiev say he scores now
that two years ago and every student is striving to reach that ultimate goal of being the best
friend and a great the best in class to get in to a good college a good job and so that worry for
the future I would say is the largest stash a stressor for students to some extent we're talking
about here the heart of this is attacking stick so I mentioned beginning that this desire that as a
society physical health problems between the same way as men off maybe pick up the other
way amid a broader would between the same way with the same language it was the same
level of concern but more than a billion actually openly talk about them will this necessarily
lead to that this gives students the ability to take a mental health day legal lee but do you think
they'll actually feel comfortable doing so I believe that eventually this will absolutely be to that
from the point of view as a student as someone with mental health problems knowing that
your school community and state pay your well-being on the same level as physical health just
knowing that that's out there and not go on I think it makes things a lot more comfortable and I
hope that it will make teachers and admin lot more comfortable talking about Hoffa the same
way as well I think it gives us an opportunity for a conversation that's what this whole campaign
is done when this went viral a couple of days ago this gave these students the opportunity to
talk openly about mental health and that's the point now we have a conversation now when
you call registry saying I have I have an anxiety attack and having a panic attack and I still can't
come in today back is that register the ability to go to a counselor at the school and say Hey you
know he had a panic attack what can we do to intervene and change the conditions within that
school I'm glad you brought that up because I'm wondering what role you think schools play
and as if if from for parents says Hey my way 7th grader isn't coming in because she has strep
throat chances are and hopefully that parent will go to the doctor there will be some antibiotics
and then in a day or two that signal will be back if that if a parent says my 7th graders not
coming today because she has is having a panic attack what is the school's responsibility I think
the schools get all of the school people that I've talked with welcome the opportunity for the
conversation they welcome the opportunity to engage whether they've got counselors on site
to do that or contracts or whatever we also know that that new school funding package just
came in so think about partnering with a new 80 million $ that came and that highlights social
emotional well-being schools now we're gonna open a whole different conversation because
schools are going to know there's a problem they know kids are struggling they know we and
the students there before the school knows when kids are going to suicide or suicide has been
completed we all think that when a suicide happens and I talked to a lot of school
administrators who are like we can't talk about that because if we talk about it will happen
again and that's just not true we brought together 130 school administrators counselors and
students earlier this year to talk about you suicide what we can do to pull together suicide
Prevention plans at the school level and it was fascinating the stigma that out there and the
belief that still if you talk about it you don't like J.J. video what will happen with a student in in
another school district they produced video the family it was beautiful they really had a
statement said everybody struggling with something and school in the show because they were
afraid that glorify suicide we have to have those conversations we have to realize and recognize
that not talking about suicide is making it worse if you just see him talking right now with haley
Hardcastle she just graduate from high school she will be going in her first year at University of
92

Oregon just a few months she was a student who pushed for a new law and order was signed
by governor Kate Brown last month it will give students the ability to take days Off for mental
or behavioral health reasons robert henderson is with us as well Dr psychology and chief
executive of behavior health Providence health Haley Hardcastle as I know you know one of the
critiques of this idea is that young people to take advantage of the system don't give them one
more way to easily without some kind of obvious check like not looking at some uncertainty
they really just an easy way to get out of school when they don't have some kind of mental or
behavioral health for peace and what's your response to that particular critique through that I
say that students are already skipping school and the students who are going to skip school
when they don't really need to are always going to not always been a thing it's always going to
but if this can help even one person who truly is struggling then it's all been worth it as well as
in students are skipping school and line that bears physically ill and it's just diseases lying about
mental health condition you know I can say I have the flu when I don't actually or I can say I
have depression and I actually and I say that this is just another way that their equal and it
bears potential for abuse whether it's this or mental health I want to run another sampling of
responses but it is these came all from response to the economical ran on art and life just a
couple days ago one person wrote what happens to these kids when they leave school and face
the real world no doubt these kids are set up to fail another said another example of opposing
grown-ups not able to tell the children not even exactly sure that means another said this is
coddling afford throat next up Cookie's milk and a nap there were more than 5 under
comments and the vast majority of them were I assume adult I'm not sure we're also seeing a
variant of you're just treating kids you know to softly and and this is not to have them up for
the harsh realities of the real world where you can't just take time off like this because you're
having a hard time that was from hundreds and hundreds of comments how to respond to that
basic idea well first of all the students have been pushing us have already seen a lot of those
comments because we want people to know that we consider all sides this before we pushed
into legislature we thought about what happens to her peers abuse it what happens if this is
too much calling but in the end we decide mental health is more important not and arming
response to those critics have been that you know they basically claiming not the real world
except us because we care about ourselves because we care about taking care of ourselves but
I love to see a society that doesn't make us work 110% of the time to be successful and I know
that's the reality sometimes but adults need to know how to take care of themselves how to
take a break as well and we're hoping that by teaching these young students how to take care
of themselves when it's okay to take breaks you can be more productive when you come back
we're hoping that battle raised a generation of adults who know how to do the same thing I'm
curious about Henderson in those comments you seen him and maybe he's not the only options
left between these two do some self-selecting disgruntled set of online commenters who were
eager to tell you know somehow find something negative reaction to news things or do you see
a real generational divide here where adults arm iron have to have some inability it seems to
understand what young people today are going through I see that generational divide loud and
clear I see stick rearing its ugly head I see denial that depressions thing I.C.E. people who still
believe this actually happened during testimony where one senator looked at them and said
you know he's got to pick yourself up by your bootstraps and seriously do we look at people
who complete suicide were struggling with chronic suicide note said audience say we just you
93

pick yourself up by your bootstraps that stop with depression looks like That's not what things
iay it looks like that's not what people living with mental illness are doing we have to get
yourself to the point where we accept and understand and I do think it's a generational thing
that mental illness is real it's not your head and it is as important as the physical health mind
and body are connected by more than our nap so we feel good and we're taking care of herself
he's point we're far more productive than we are we were struggling mightily an anxious and
just flailing about I see our generation doing he had cast what was it like for you and your fellow
students to testify and him to talk to lawmakers to block before this bill it was really daunting at
first you know it's really easy as teenagers to feel like adults while lessons here as that happens
sometimes but I'm once we got down to the capital we saw other teenagers very saw people
who looks just like us trying to make changes while and Allah Super inspiring and then once
they got into a room at a majority of legislatures could not have been more supportive and that
really give us hope for the future and made the whole process flight easy and you know on
some level what this bill does is it's not a Band-Aid but it it is not the solution either to mental
health it it's a way for people who are already having problems to take one step back for a day
or two to hopefully get some help what more do you want schools to do so that young people
wouldn't even need to take those days in the first place I completely agree this isn't the final
solution this is just a step in the right direction and I think the next step is more funding for
mental health resources and education in schools and not only for students also parents said
that way that generational divide can be lessened as we move forward what about you Robin
Anderson mean what would you like schools to do specifically I like to see him really
understand it they're the place for students are and we have to help them build out resources
said that counselors they heard this is where health happens we're talking about mental health
and well-being we're very comfortable in schools talking about everything from sexual health
we can do that for years and look what we've done we've done a lot of good around that we
now need to take those same principles and apply them to mental health and well-being of this
generation who lives with the stressors of in your face social media every day he's been
phenomenal to watch this happen and he's very brave students have been subject to a lot of
very negative commentary and they're very resilient people but we have to help an entire
generation develop skills that we as adults don't we as adults aren't skilled social media and our
leading the way they live it we need to put that in our schools as well pay her tesla do you feel
like you're actually have things you need to teach older Oregonians were older americans Yeah
absolutely I don't think necessarily teaches the right word because there are no lie I just like to
make them aware of what we're really going to the rally reality of it one example of that is
social media a lot of times a lot of the commentary seen have pointed to social media as the
source of mental health problems that is the end-all be-all and a lot of adults minds but that's
not the truth a lot of mental health issues are triggered by traumatic event someone's life and
give school stressors as we mentioned earlier and part of his social media the not even
necessarily cyber bullying as many adults believe it's a comparison that happened on social

cbs news has learned jeffrey epstein is now n under round-the-clock watch at the metropolitan
correctional center after what appears to have been an attempted suicide. law enforcement
sources say epstein was found lying on the floor of his jail cell earlier this week, semicon
despondent and crying with slight bruising around his neck. according to cbs news sources, it
seems epstein's clothing wasl used in the apparent attempt. the 66-year-old was treated at the
jail's infirmary for non- life-threatening injuries. epstein had been at the correctional facility in
an isolated cell with 30-minute wellness checks since last thursday. the former hedge fund
manager, who once called the world's rich and powerful his friends, was arrested on july 6,
accused of j sex trafficking and sexually abusing dozens of underaged girls, as young as 14, from
2002nde to 2005. >> we would prefer that jeffrey epstein stay alive and face justice, which he
so richly deserves. >> reporter: lisa bloom represents several women who claimed epstein
sexually abused them. >> prosecutors may very well argue that a suicide attempt indicates
consciousness of guilt. why else would somebody want to take their own life, unless they had
done some terrible things and were about to face justice for this. >> o'donnell: and mola is
outside the jail tonight. what are your sources telling you tonight? >> reporter: well, norah, law
enforcement sources are telling us that officials here at the correctional center are reviewing

over what happened inside his cell >> reporter: jeffrey epstein was found on the floor of his cell
semiconscious in a fetal position with marks around his neck there are conflicting explanations
from multiple law enforcement sources. one theory is that epstein tried to take his own life
another is that the 66-year-old faked a suicide to try to get transferred from this notorious jail
in manhattan. but the possibility that epstein was attacked is also being considered two people
familiar with the incident tell nbc's new york station that epstein shared a cell with nick, a
former police officer accused of murder. nick's lawyers say his client was questioned but is not
a suspect. >> he did nothing wrong at all and he's not being investigated for doing anything
wrong he's not been accused of doing anything wrong >> reporter: a judge denied epstein's bail
after he pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking charges leaving him locked up until trial, a sharp
contrast to his luxury homes in new mexico, new york, and the caribbean. local zoning permits
show epstein was expanding his compound from this island to a second one bought in 2016.
these islands are public property, but jeffrey epstein made it clear the rest of this island is not.
he's been doing construction here up until his arrest we're told that this white shed was built
only a few months ago. epstein may never be back. the rest of his life could be spent behind
bars. stephanie gosk, nbc news.

first I want to talk about jeffrey epstein last night this time it o'clock we talked about jeffrey of
these kind of a little bit of an update on that if he had heard in jimmy abstain was found injured
on the floor of his sale last night this happened it was last night it weighs Here's the deal right
99

now this is what they've been saying according to a source they are saying it is not clear
whether his injuries were self-inflicted but that ep Steyn was put on suicide watch at the
Correctional facility as a precautionary measure and his injuries are life threatening so night
now law enforcement sources they say everything was found lying on the floor for sale of semiconscious despondent crime with slight bruising around his neck and account looks like a fairly
that the clothes we used to do this mace and not Here's my take on this I'm keep it very simple
if he commits suicide which I'm quite sure are there some that don't want him to commit
suicide but I think there are a lot of power full people that what jeffrey esteem for him to go
night for good because you want to talk about somebody that had know where the bodies are
buried he's the guy he is the guy mother what about clinton but what about everybody Yeah
this they just bill Clinton known this it dropped this is Yeah everybody somebody some I read
that somebody close said Jeffrey Epstein said one time that you know a lot of people collect a
lot of different things and esteemed collected powerful people that he just that was his thing
and he put them in a lot of situations that are black male bull etc so Yeah it's do sometimes talk
to you a bit we don't do a good job is because go down rabbit holes but sometimes we talk
about the news man I guess to get so many conversation the rabbit hole we go down before we
get to the next piece of news me ask you this and you think you would be grounded it me here
in Minnesota Money in the laws don't apply to if you had unlimited the body you right like I'm I
listen I am not condoning anything jeffrey epstein is done yet this isn't an excuse this no but
this is moot trying to just like sit back and think of all the powerful people that have been able
to continue to just live a lawless and do what they want how they want I mean this man not
only was he had unlimited money but there's no law that applied to them if you try to apply the
law to them you have a choice you can either die whom or you can take this payoff threat both
your choices this Yeah I don't I don't think that money and power make you know start like a
pedophile rings or anything that's way out there but if I had a if I if I hate losing his situation
financially there are I'm sure there are some rules that I follow now all that I've wouldn't need
to follow at that point makes people crazy I am crazy it but I don't think it this is my prediction I
don't think he ever one testified he'll either I think he's e's either going to be successful in doing
it to himself or somebody else get him out or he just says I'm not saying nothing because he has
or way too much information.

people can live longer but lose a lot of everyday abilities which can frustrate and depression the
elderly the then lose people close to the children who grow up and move around the country
spouses and civilians who died friends began to fade and us my friend who died as a recent
about Simon chief at the in deep snow there what was it well you know say you lose in each
when they die and cancer and all kinds of things that's one of the most difficult things and here
we should say that part of this story will be hard to hear because it's about this sobering
statistic people 65 years of age and older now account for nearly a 5th of all suicides in this
country and older people who attempt suicide are much more likely to die I think you begin to
question your value you begin to question your purpose Dr harry reid is a senior vice president
of the Education development center in Washington D.C. where he works to prevent suicides
among the elderly if you start to feel like you don't belong and your burden and you have
access to lethal means whether it's medication whether it's a file or whatever and you don't
think there's hope resolution in the future those dynamics can contribute to use starting to
think about maybe the world would be better off without me many experts cite many reasons
why this may be true but often begin by saying a lot of elderly people no longer feel useful I
think we have a culture of when you work you have value and when you no longer work we
kind of dismiss you Dr. Julie record founded the suicide Prevention coalition of North central
Washington state in 2012 following a rash of suicides nearby the thing I get asked often is you
know why do we care right I think you know people say they're going to die anyway they're
seniors him isn't that part of being older and and so people feel about and seniors feel accent I
know that part of the struggle that my mom is how is the loss of identity ducky record brought
her mother Sherry Adler or energy 72 has suffered two strokes and says older people with
frailties can in her words I think in their houses it sometimes I eat in afraid to drive and
sometimes I'm afraid to go go anywhere because I'm afraid I'm going to fall I hurt myself really
bad one eye for so it kind of leaves me in the House and it's sad you get a lower rate is me
that's why I had though like to run Marit impact on the people off because nobody else was cut
to me Emily us a mental illness said something but if they liked it or not hurtful and personal

and I just made a stupid mistake like I guess so I just wanted to give up because I felt like I
wasn't a good mom and that's all I ever wanted to be I gotta ask you what a stupid mistake was
fish trying to cure myself yeah that was a tough call I received dr record is on her way home at
the time her mother had driven her to the airport and had changed planes on our way back to
Washington state and so during that lead over she called said I just want to say goodbye I love
you and I just appreciate everything you've ever done and normally I would think that's a sign
of suicide but it was during my lead over so I just left her and my whole life she had always
cried when I laugh then Dan and I would always say I love you too and but this time I'm sorry
there was a body us it was very painful for both jillian I it's one of those things where I question
myself because of my work thank you and I'm preventing suicide with everybody but not my
mom but it wasn't her fault it's not like I told her if anything and they didn't tell her anything
because I didn't even know that things got so bad that I was just not on area have got the
professional help including medication and says she's no longer so despondent she thinks she
might move closer to her daughter Washington state factor record says her own mother's
suicide attempt remind der many elderly people find it hard to seek help their often parents
and grandparents who see no loss of life they feel they should be the ones to offer help what
he had always been the one to do it she's always been strong on right I mean my mom was the
Warriors ass in my life and so now we're also were first parenting cherries my kids alone hands

volunteer with a local group called who wrote back he groomed for generations that provides
services to elderly people the two women think of their visits is a friendship between

of alcohol very emotional as most people out there he's going with his mood up and down up
and down and i'm going with them and it doesn't it's not going very well i'm not able to connect
with him that well he's not giving much information and keeps looking down that much
commander you know what this isn't going very well this this make a bed my one step back and
casey goes he's not on stay right here okay so I keep going and we found out we are what we
call cooks things like connect with him with that family where that something sports we can
connect with we found out about his family and continue with that how would your family feel
you think with you've gone and we expanded on that it was going well and also he just turns
around hold on the table looks at the water start doing this heavy breathing and for me that's a
big indication that he's going to go so I had heard of a technique and one time he really tried
this is during this type of situation so I did this they its to snap a map of that sequence of what
he's doing whether the county heavy breathing and work and work well and I turned around he
was angry at me for doing that but we’re connected with us hey brother i'm here for you I want
to see anything so we talked about this for a kept going about the family kept focusing on that
he decided okay you listened i'm going to come back over so he did on his own fantastic
fantastic we've got some help taken to hospital and that's not a movie that he's involved in
that's real life and he's got to figure out how to make a connection we've noticed he used the
word listen and he did it because you can connect somebody if you don't listen to the cake
when these things with a plan because everybody's different and how common is what he's like
it's just he's just already you know he's got that just perfect demeanor to figure out how to do
that my goodness he's not in a rush here's kevin telling the story of another encounter with the
would-be jumper coincidentally this man was named kevin to do there again on the golden gate
109

bridge I received a call a man over the rail respond with my motorcycle alongside walk down
there I saw him on the sidewalk when he saw me push right over the rail I thought he was gone
around the two towers the bridge it's just a small pipe kevin stood on that small pipe for 90
minutes during the 90 minutes my knees were heard like hill because I was kneeling down
talking to him so he could look down on me it's like a power him that's what this is all about for
most of this except for 5 minutes I listened kevin spewed things out I was crying his birth
mother had abandoned him his depression all these things school being bullied all these things
had taken a toll on him and nobody had listened I see it varies listen but actually it's really not if
you're given their full attention and you're hearing what's going on and that your own agenda
and trying to think okay how about top that story what can I do what's the response going to be
if we can just take this and listen it's very difficult to do we're not talk to listen we're taught to
read write and do math all these things we're not talk to listen how we do things when we're up
on that bridge we use active listening skills open-ended questions paraphrasing summers
nation I messages to connect with these folks high emotions people low rational thought so we
try to stretch that time not as long as we can follow just walk up and say about what he done
for one the uniform scares people it does I know that we walk slow we approach slow I asked
their permission come up and speak with them i'm empowered them as much as I can
whatever cooks but I can get family friends sports where ever it is we'll go with that and we'll
talk about that we expand on that we expand that time to allow the rational thought come back
up and this is basically how it works this is what we do some damaging phrases that we do not
use call down really gets people angry when you say that more you shouldn't you should they
don't like that either nobody likes hearing that you should do this you should do that doesn't
work it had you tried this works much better have you tried this why am places blame makes
me very angry makes us saying why did you do that why you hear you I didn't understand
what's going on and I understand my favorite do we really million do I understand when he's
over that rail know I may have depression but it doesn't go to that level I don't understand but
so far I understand you correctly if I hear you correctly and tell you how they feel and we can
correct that very very important kevin did come back over that room that day after that 90
minutes we were invited to new york city recommendation for suicide prevention eons he
spoke there and actively speaks not to people about what happened during his life how to get
to that level he didn't know how to get to the bridge she doesn't remember even drive into the
bridge that day but he got there he was a rail it wasn't I saved him I say nobody nobody not one
person and they've been a conduit for these people come back over the rail this them doing it
they're the ones to make that decision it's easy to let go and for very easy it's much harder to
come back with real he said those same problems when he came back over there they're not
going away but he faced those polled of his boot straps went head-on on the east has issues we
all do but he's here and he's doing really well and that's kevin briggs a retired california highway

most schools are limits sick days to about 5 person master of kids go over any written
permission that's been the policy in Oregon public schools but now they're adding mental
health days under a new push by young people and recently signed by governor kate brown
mental health will be equal to physical health to reduce the stigma of mental illness and try to
lower the state suicide rate one of the highest in the country could finance is executive director
of the national alliance on mental illness or nominee in Oregon he's in portland because no
students not adults champion this bill inspired by the parkland students who advocated for gun
control the student why do the same for mental health why how big is this problem in your
state the problem is here genet growing and you cited the suicide rate for the state of Oregon
but it's even more than Oregon like nationally you're saying a higher level of prevalence but
certain disorders such as depression and anxiety among young people and we're not just talking
high school students were talking elementary school grades and the impacts are growing in the
tremendous honor young people infected read Oregon has a suicide rate 40% higher than the
national average what do you think is going on it's really hard to tell but Oregon has not only
higher suicide rate for young people also for adults but also have slightly higher prevalence of
mental health disorders substance use disorders than the national average we can see are
these impact not only on suicide but those catastrophic outcomes we don't really talk about
how much they fly under the radar that more likely to drop out of school more likely for
families to be torn apart more likely to be unemployed clear on we have this one indicated very
catastrophic somebody dying we have also these other outcomes the take a tremendous toll on
our state bus how these mental health day's work doesn't trigger any response in the school
right I mean there are again just like any kind of chronic illness or something that I will deal as a
young person over my life there maybe accommodations that are necessary I think it's also

116

important to note that we're not saying this is a mental health day as that its casual use in the
workplace with it these are real disorders that have real impacts on students.

spaces in your life we can't articulate because your mind is so on in a quandary the creative arts
are absolutely essential and the cornerstone for spirituality whatever maybe I think it's there
that we can find our unity and healing for minds and souls I had become psychotic and was on
the streets and I have lost contact with my family and just what the process is that brought me
back to reality was losing my most valuable saying in my life at that point that accurate with me
was my flute I lost the food and kayleigh I had a ceremony letting go of the flu which was such a
powerful part of me using and flute to bring in new me and so my goal in life is to use the words

118

very creative child I remember once around the neighborhood with the question they're
looking for friends and I think she was about 5 years old at the time they had to fill out a
questionnaire but that was carrying an when she hit puberty we started having a few problems
karen at that point in her life was very melancholy whores for was kind of like good dark
shadows that you followed her around she was a ski racer and they had a private ski academy
and gurgling this is a town and she went there for her senior year of high school so she really
wasn't much in to know all the clicks in that wow are high school thing was but as she made
great friends there and she loved it and ensure annoyed college in california can know she got
into drinking and I think it was her sophomore year I got a call from one of the counselors said
that they were sending your home karen took some time at home she got sober and italy
healthier and managed to return to college analogy she finished her degree and they can't get
work in movies and tv then she moved closer to home one night I think it was actually eastern
we've got a phone call at home her boyfriend that he was worried about their I am that she
wasn't answering her phone so I did what you know what you can do when you're a living 3
hours away from someone I call the police cannot pass a wellness check cotter and they did but
that that and ran away soup come between us because she didn't like the idea that college
athletes and how years maybe less than a year after she moved down to portland got a letter
from her it was just this horrible matter about I don't want ever see anybody again i've me it's
just very hurtful very striking out against all of us I do I didn't know what had triggered it it's
heartbreaking you think you know your child and then something like that happens and you
can't figure out why we didn't see each other for quite a while and then one day she called me
and wanted me to come to portland but I had to come back myself she would kill whoever
came with me there was a very radical and so we called her doctor and the doctor said call the
police and so I started down to portland and my husband col the place and they went to her
apartment and she would not let the man who so they've found together key from the manager
and and when they came in to the apartment she tried to jump off a balcony in the cotr and
they ended up having to wrestle her to the floor and cover taker in the ambulance this summer
of 2014 she was living in this house in portland we were supporting her and that summers she
decided to move out of the house when she moved out of the house she sort of moved out of
our lives to him she got very aggressive and very threatening she told issues coming apart
sound answers and callous and we actually went and got a restraining order and the lies that
they just didn't seem to be any help she had been trying to get social security disability and kate
I kept getting turned down for a nap so from that summer of 14 until october we hadn't heard
from her in a while new shoes living in her car and then she contacted us in late october and I
got together with third and you know we cried and hugged him talk to I think she was
embarrassed by all the things that happen and things she said I think she he felt like it was
hopeless like she was never gonna be able to get back to the place where she could support
yourself or payoff for deaths our whatever you don't have life thanksgiving this coming and I
ask effect in common she said yes that's all she said is yes and I got half the area calderon do
there's no answer which is unusual but I got to her place her roommate was there we open the
door to care instrument she was saying he she had hung herself from the skylight and she here
and that there's not there's no way to explain what that was like people talk about having a
broken heart I honestly felt like my heart has been ripped out of me and there's not a day that
goes by that I don't think it matters I think about all the things that she missed and things that
119

she never got a chance to have a family of her own sometimes they see people out that looked
like her they found them there would be times said in my car and I would just scream as loud as
I could scream but a lot of times this is this empty feeling they had a memorial for her and los
angeles and they sent me the book from that that things that people road and the book or like
she was such a big part of their life and how she helped them cope and you know that she was
so strong and thing I think about that and I think you know why I know why did she give a look
at end yeah I i don't know and then on top of everything else she died in november I think it
was january february social security paid your disability which was almost like a slap in the face
because I think had they come through I think it would stop after I think that would have been
the hope that she felt like she needed that she we had would have had some income of around
and she had no family no years the money went to me that's the money used to start this
project that's when I got together with the eu and the chocolate to talk to different ways to
honor care and memory and they found themselves drawn back to the importance of creativity
insurance life care was very artistic and we knew we wanted to do something around the arts
carol can I think care and used her art to cope with some of her game and it's and she had this
place set up in her garage where she would do her heart and it just seemed like such a natural
fit for her I just think that this is something good that came after something so terrible and
years it just makes me feel very happy now I kind of say the word tears see what's going on you
know how you feel about that and I do think she would just love it I think she would be here
and she would be doing all kinds of things and then you know when I leave I just it's just good
for my heart.

7 new York city police officers have died by suicide in 2019 it's not just a New York problem
according to the mental health advocacy group who helped 100 and 11 police officers around
the United States had killed themselves so far this year as well as I have dozens of other first
responders the suicides are forcing police departments around the country to find new ways to
respond to their officers need for mental health services and to get past the stigma of talking
about it joining me now to discuss the ongoing struggle with mental health in police
departments is University of Buffalo epidemiologist John Nealon T John welcome to take away I
think it's good to be here so being a police officer or a first responder is stressful to say the least
but what does this recent cluster of people who have died by suicide tell us is this out of the
ordinary or does this happen regularly but generally we don't have such such large clusters of
servicemen occurring all at the same time like this and it's rather unusual we have seen a
steady stream of police was size over the years so we've looked at data on police suicides over
the last 20 to 30 years and punish average of 100 police officers Courier killed themselves but
we're seeing in new York city and on we've seen in Chicago is rather unusual I think a lot has to
do with the way society is today I think is a lot of conflict going whole lot of fun negative
aspersions toward police officers making the job of course more difficult bank officers feel
isolated they feel unappreciated and the stunning turnaround the ability to cope with adversity
they see every day what other cities are struggling with this and is it limited to the United
States Wells Chicago Chicago's again high crime in Chicago while homicides alone and her city a
120

lot of trauma San Francisco Dallas so it is not just a United States problem where look that's
resides in France the suicide rate in France this time the His time the clear suicide side South
Africa this time it seems that every country in the bed the researchers look police officers have
a higher suicide rates in general working population and that's true on the United States as well
John have we seen historically at least in the 21st 20th century words they have there been
other moments where these clusters of officers dying by suicide have cropped up you howie
and looking back at our data back in the last part of the 19 sixties we saw us was so piquant the
suicides and that kind of reminded me of a conflict of the way society was back in the late 60s
and all of the unrest in our country and kind of parallel to what we're seeing today United
States now a lot of unrest lot of conflict so I think that has something to do that when you
isolate people from society has police officers are starting to feel the sense of belonging us to of
being part of society makes one more susceptible to depression a few weeks ago my colleague
W N.Y.C. host Jimmy Floyd spoke with NYPD Commissioner james O'Neill about new efforts that
the new York city police Department is making to get its police officers help O'Neill said that
one of the big problems and we've heard this on many levels in policing is there's a culture of
silence when it comes to accessing talking about mental health Let's take a listen to a clip and
sometimes in in law enforcement and policing it takes awhile to change but this is something
that needs to change immediately how this is our duty is our responsibility why does this stigma
exist in within the police community John well help us to come from the top down and I think
the Commissioner has done a good thing by doing this that's staying news more well versed
throughout the police culture the police culture is a strong culture too few to come forward
with a mental health problem you might be perceived as being weak so if I'm told as a police
officer that should never be we all should be stein nothing should ever bother me I'm not going
to come forward when they start feeling emotions about the horrible things I stand I'm straight
so officers very the clock it up and sign and eventually it comes out who what we need to do
this to reduce the stigma Associated with alcohol to train police officers especially we have to
recruit level when they first come in to the police Academy and to understand and having
mental health difficulty is very much the same as having a broken arm it's very important to
inoculate like used were inoculated to inoculate young police recruits about this it's very
important to train and supervisors to understand these aspects of not understand the science
of suicide signs of depression era officers training I think training is essential her isn't there are
also fears that beyond the stigma isn't there are also fears about the officer could lose their job
and that the officer could have cared a firearm taken from then it doesn't that also play a role
in this it does Yeah beyond fears greater than logic if come forward look at what the problem
I'm not going to get promoted door my fellow officers are not going to trust me or Ms. Perez's
will not trust me how be called crazy I'll be scapegoated that's a real fear in this culture we
need increased trust Between police administration and that officer in the works on the Street
and that that takes a lot of doing you know because a lot of police officers don't trust the
administration so Commissioner Neil comes forward you saw us these things that's important
that's important to build that trust if we don't have that but still in hiding and Stone suffered
and still going to die by suicide the University of Buffalo professor John the align T thanks for
joining us broker Rocco taken if you or someone you know might be considering suicide please
